The overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was clearly associated with carcinogenesis, and COX-2 as a possible target has long been exploited for cancer therapy. A group of 29 derivatives of 1, 5-diarylpyrazole was used to study its structural requirements using three-dimensional quantitative structure–activity relationship (3D-QSAR), the density functional theory method, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics. Four 3D-QSAR models were developed, and the predictive capability of the four selected models was also successfully tested using different validation methods. The contribution contours of the comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative molecular similarity index analysis (CoMSIA) models effectively illustrate the relationships between the various chemical characteristics and their biological activities. Using the density functional theory method with the 6-31G (d, p) basis set and the Becke, 3-parameter, Lee-Yang-Parr (B3LYP) function to evaluate chemical reactivity properties, the results obtained from energy gaps of 3.431, 3.446, and 2.727 ev for molecules numbers 21, 22, and 23 indicate that these three molecules have good chemical stability and reactivity and select the most reactive regions in the three molecules studied. Molecular docking results revealed that the active sites of the COX-2 protein (PDB code: 3PGH) were residues ARG222, THR212, HIS386, HIS207, TYR148, and ASP382, in which the most active ligands and now ligands can inhibit the COX-2 enzyme. Based on the various results obtained by molecular modeling, four new compounds (N1, N2, N3, and N4) were proposed with significant predicted activity by different 3D-QSAR models. A molecular docking study and molecular dynamics simulations of the proposed new molecules (N1 and N2) and the most active molecule over 100 ns revealed that all three molecules establish multiple hydrogen interactions with several residues and also exhibit frequent stability throughout the simulation period. As a result, it is strongly recommended to consider the two newly proposed molecules, N1 and N4, as promising candidates for novel anti-cancer agents specifically designed to target COX-2 inhibition.
