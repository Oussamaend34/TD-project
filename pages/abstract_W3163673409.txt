Abstract In agriculture, weeds cause direct damage to the crop, and it primarily affects the crop yield potential. Manual and mechanical weeding methods consume a lot of energy and time and do not give efficient results. Chemical weed control is still the best way to control weeds. However, the widespread and large-scale use of herbicides is harmful to the environment. Our study's objective is to propose an efficient model for a smart system to detect weeds in crops in real-time using computer vision. Our experiment dataset contains images of two different weed species well known in our region strained in this region with a temperate climate. The first is the Phalaris Paradoxa. The second is Convolvulus, manually captured with a professional camera from fields under different lighting conditions (from morning to afternoon in sunny and cloudy weather). The detection of weed and crop has experimented with four recent pre-configured open-source computer vision models for object detection: Detectron2, EfficientDet, YOLO, and Faster R-CNN. The performance comparison of weed detection models is executed on the Open CV and Keras platform using python language.
