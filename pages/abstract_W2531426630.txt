Silver nanoparticles were synthesized by the reduction of the silver nitrate (AgNO3) using the latex copolymer in ethanol solution under microwave (MW) heating. The reaction parameters such as silver precursor concentration (from 0.005 to 0.1 g/l) and MW power (200–800 W) significantly affect the formation rate, shape, size and distribution of the silver nanoparticles. A significant reduction of irradiation time was observed when the MW energy is compared to conventional thermal reduction processes. The prepared silver nanoparticles show uniform and stable sizes from 5 to 11 nm, which can be stored at room temperature for approximately 12 months without any visible change. These peculiarities indicate that the latex copolymer is a good stabilizer for the silver nanoparticles. The optical properties, morphology, and crystalline structure of the silver-latex copolymer nanocomposites were characterized by the Ultraviolet–Visible spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The study of the TEM images at high magnifications identified the silver nanoparticles as face-centered cubic (fcc) structure with spherical and hexagonal shapes.
