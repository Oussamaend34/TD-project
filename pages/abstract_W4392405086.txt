Since business intelligence has played a crucial role in enhancing the competitiveness of organizations, providing insights that guide decision-making and drive business growth, and cloud technology has improved collaboration and data sharing, in this research paper we propose and emphasize the need for providing Cloud BI as a modern technology that can contribute to the growth of the economy of small and medium-sized enterprises in Morocco. We also discussed the extent to which the success of these enterprises is linked to the success of the Moroccan economy, and the importance of the relevant authorities paying special attention to these technologies, rather than relying solely on financial support, and that technological integration can help enhance the competitiveness of these companies. Finally, we concluded our research exploration by proposing a framework that adopts the migration of BI to the cloud as a special case of Cloud BI.
