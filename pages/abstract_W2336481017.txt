In this paper, we present an (m+1)-step iterative method of convergence order (m+2) for solving linear complementarity problems. The proposed iterative method is simple and easy to construct, and requiring only third Fréchet differentiation. Computational efficiency in its general form is discussed and a comparison between the efficiency of the proposed method and existing ones is made. The performance is tested through numerical experiments on some test problems.
