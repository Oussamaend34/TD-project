In recent years, the need for security of personal data is becoming progressively important. In this regard, the identification system based on fusion of multibiometric is most recommended for significantly improving and achieving the high performance accuracy. The main purpose of this paper is to propose a hybrid system of combining the effect of tree efficient models: Convolutional neural network (CNN), Softmax and Random forest (RF) classifier based on multi-biometric fingerprint, finger-vein and face identification system. In conventional fingerprint system, image pre-processed is applied to separate the foreground and background region based on K-means and DBSCAN algorithm. Furthermore, the features are extracted using CNNs and dropout approach, after that, the Softmax performs as a recognizer. In conventional fingervein system, the region of interest image contrast enhancement using exposure fusion framework is input into the CNNs model. Moreover, the RF classifier is proposed for classification. In conventional face system, the CNNs architecture and Softmax are required to generate face feature vectors and classify personal recognition. The score provided by these systems is combined for improving Human identification. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on publicly available SDUMLA-HMT real multimodal biometric database using a GPU based implementation. Experimental results on the datasets has shown significant capability for identification biometric system. The proposed work can offer an accurate and efficient matching compared with other system based on unimodal, bimodal, multimodal characteristics.
