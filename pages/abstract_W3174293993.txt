For many decades, titanium dioxide (TiO2) semiconductor has been extensively applied in several environmental applications due to its higher photocatalytic performances toward different organic pollutants, pharmaceutical compounds, and bacteria. However, its shortfall response to visible light, and the expeditious recombination rate of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs, hampers its utilization. Doping TiO2 semiconductor with silver nanoparticles is a sound strategy to (1) extend its photocatalytic activity to visible light, (2) prevent the electron/holes pairs recombination due to the formation of the Schottky barrier at the interfaces with TiO2 that act as an electron-trapping center, and (3) enhance its bactericide performances. This review focuses on the recent progress on silver-doped titanium dioxide (Ag/TiO2)-based photocatalysts. It addresses a wide range of Ag/TiO2 synthesis techniques, their physicochemical properties and discusses thoroughly the important role of silver (Ag) nanoparticles in enhancing the removal capacity and antibacterial performances of the Ag/TiO2 photocatalysts.
