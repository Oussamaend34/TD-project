Advances in recent communication systems require minimal weight, low cost, high performance and low-profile antenna to meet the demand for next generation wireless communication devices. Due to the saturation velocity, high electrical conductivity and high mobility, graphene patch antennas are preferably used in the Terahertz band region (THz). On the other hand, MIMO antenna is usually required to compensate for the high path losses and atmospheric attenuation in THz frequency band spectrum and to offer higher data rates. In this work, a fractal MIMO antenna structure is placed on SiO2 substrate embedded with Photonic Band Gap crystal (PBG). The designed MIMO antenna structure obtains an impedance bandwidth of 1590 GHz covering an effective frequency spectrum from 1.41 to 3.0 THz with a fractional bandwidth of 72.10%. Furthermore, the proposed antenna offers peak radiation efficiency of 74.5% and gain of 4.60 dBi at the resonant frequency of 1.89 THz. The proposed MIMO antenna achieves isolation levels of greater than 25 dB throughout the entire working band and also maintains a compact dimensions of only 38 μm $$\times$$ × 25 μm. The suggested photonic crystal-based MIMO antenna offers superior MIMO metrics like ECC ≈ (0.00000000156), DG (≈10 dB), MEG (≈ $$-$$ - 3 dB), TARC (≈ $$-$$ - 42 dB) and CCL (≈0.00000000465 b/Hz/sec) at the resonant frequency of 1.89 THz. Hence, the prescribed MIMO radiator can be utilized for various applications such as threat detection, material characterization, near field communication, detection of explosive and medical imaging in the terahertz band.
