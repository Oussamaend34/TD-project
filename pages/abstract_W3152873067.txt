The corrosion inhibition behavior of sodium nitrite (NaNO2) towardspure copper (99.95%) in simulated cooling water (SCW) was investigated by means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and dynamic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (DEIS). NaNO2 interferes with metal dissolution and reduce thecorrosionrate through the formation or maintenance of inhibitive film on the metal surface. Surface morphologies illustrated that the surface homogeneity increased on adding sodium nitrite. Sodium nitrite’s adsorption on copper surface followed the modified form of Langmuir, Freundlich and Frumkin isotherms. Physiosorption mode was involved in the corrosion protection. Electrochemical results revealed an corrosion resistance of copper increases on increasing the inhibitor concentration. The DEIS results indicated that copper corrosion mechanism could be hindered by 50% even after interval of 24h by optimum concentration of sodium nitrite. The maximum inhibition was achieved with 2000ppm of NaNO2. With this concentration, inhibition efficiencyof up to 61.8% was achievable.
