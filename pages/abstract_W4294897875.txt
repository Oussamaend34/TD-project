Breast Cancer remains, according to the World Health Organization, the most complex disease cancer in 2021 in the world and the most common cause of death among women. Based on unequivocal scientific data, the establishment of an operative program for prevention could save lives of millions women suffering from breast cancer. In this update review, we highlight the major risk factors related to breast cancer investigated in women over the last 5 years. Thus, we clarify the involvement of these risk factors in the occurrence and growth of breast cancer. Investigations of 15 studies (n = 1,254,418; six case–control studies, five cohort studies, three prospective studies, and one meta-analysis) revealed that age, family history, obesity, use of oral contraceptives, status menopausal, smoking, alcohol consumption, lifestyle, and genetics factors are significantly linked to breast cancer. Additional studies are needed to corroborate these outcomes and initiate new practices aimed at preventing breast cancer.
