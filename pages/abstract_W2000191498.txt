Potato virus Y (PVY) strain groups are based on host response and resistance gene interactions. The strain groups PVYO, PVYC and PVYN are well established for the isolates infecting potato in the field. A switch in the emphasis from host response to nucleotide sequence differences in the virus genomes, detection of isolates recombining sequences of different strains, and the need to recognize isolates that cause necrotic symptoms in potato tubers have led to the assignment of new acronyms, especially to isolates of the PVYN strain group. This discussion paper proposes that any newly found isolates should be described within the context of the original strain groups based on the original methods of distinguishing strains (i.e., tobacco and potato assays involving use of ‘differential’ potato cultivars). Additionally, sequence characterization of the complete genomes of isolates is highly recommended. However, it is acceptable to amend the names of PVY isolates with additional, specific codes to show that the isolate differs at the molecular, serological or phenotypic level from the typical strains within a strain group. The new isolates should preferably not be named using geographical, cultivar, or place-association designations. Since many new variants of PVY are being discovered, any new static classification system will be meaningless for the time being. A more systematic investigation and characterization of PVY from potato at the biological and molecular levels should eventually result in a biologically meaningful genetic strain concept.
