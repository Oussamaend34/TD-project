Microalgal polysaccharides (PSs) may be an effective elicitor agent that can efficiently protect plants against biotic stresses. In this study, wee investigates, the effect of PS obtained from microalgae and cyanobacteria (D. salina MS002, P. tricorontum MS023, Porphyridium sp. MS081, Desmodesmus sp., D. salina MS067 and A. platensis MS001) on the biochemical and metabolomics markers linked to defense pathways in tomato plants. The phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), chitinase, 1,3-beta-glucanase and peroxidase (POX) activities have been improved in tomato plants leaves treated by polysaccharides extracted from P. triocnutum (238.26%); Desmodesmus sp. (19.95%); P. triocnutum (137.50%) and Porphyridium sp. (47.28%) respectively. For proteins, polyphenols and H2O2, the maximum effect was induced by D. salina 067 (55.01%), Porphyridium sp. (3.97%) and A. platensis (35.08%) respectively. On the other hand, Gas Chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) metabolomics analysis showed that PSs induced the modification of metabolite profile involved in the wax construction of tomato leaves, such as fatty acids, alkanes, alkenes and phytosterol. PS treatments improved the accumulation of fatty acids C16:3, C18:2 and C18:3 released from the membrane lipids as precursors of oxylipin biosynthesis which are signaling molecules of plant defense. In addition, PS treatment induced the accumulation of C18:0 and Azelaic acid which is a regulator of salicylic acid-dependent systemic acquired resistance. However, molecular and metabolic studies can determine more precisely the mode of action of microalgal polysaccharides as biostimulants/elicitors plant defense.
