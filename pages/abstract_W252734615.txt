The effect of extraction conditions on polyphenols contents and condensed tannins by microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) was studied for the first time to our knowledge. Moroccan barks of Acacia mollissima was used to extract phenolic compounds. The variables studied are the following: power extraction, time extraction and solvent nature. Five powers extraction were tested: 150 W, 250 W, 300 W, 450 W and 600 W. A significant effect of power extraction on the extractable nature was proved by ANOVA and Student test. The yields were also affected by time extraction. Different solvent (water, ethanol, methanol and ethyl acetate) were tested to evaluate the best extraction solvent according to the extractable nature. Highest polyphenols contents were obtained with methanol. The proportion of this solvent, time extraction and power extraction were optimized using the response surface methodology (RSM). A face-centered composite design (FCCD) was applied to evaluate the effects of these variables on the polyphenols and condensed tannins contents. For each experiment, the extraction yield, the total polyphenolic contents and the condensed tannins contents were quantified using colorimetric essays. The extracts were characterized by their reactivity to formaldehyde and reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The highest polyphenols content was obtained at 156 W using 80% of methanol during 5 min. For condensed tannins, the highest content of cyanidin was obtained at 182 W using 20% of methanol during 3.66 min. RSM applied in MAE, permitted to develop green extraction process of polyphenols and tannins extracted, using lower microwave power and methanol proportion with a shortest time extraction and in the same time improve the quantity of extractables obtained from renewable natural resource.
