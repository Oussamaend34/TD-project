This study explores the effectiveness of English as a medium of instruction (EMI) in the Arabian/Persian Gulf, with special focus on the situation in the United Arab Emirates. The study, undertaken at six universities located in major cities of Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Al Ain, Sharjah, Ajman, and Ras Al Khaimah, examines students’ and teachers’ perceptions about the use of English to teach subject matter. A total of 500 students and 100 teachers responded via survey questionnaires and structured interviews about the effectiveness of EMI. Results suggest that the current EMI situation leaves much to be desired with students struggling to learn the subject matter due to their low-proficiency in English. This paper suggests implementing a bilingual curriculum in which instruction is delivered in English and Arabic in order to enhance students’ linguistic and biliteracy skills. The study has implications for language education policy issues in the Gulf and advocates bilingual education as a means to improving students’ mastery of English, while preserving their national identity and indigenous culture.
