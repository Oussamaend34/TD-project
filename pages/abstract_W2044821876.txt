Summary Empirical experience with genomic selection in dairy cattle suggests that the distribution of the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) might be far from normality for some traits. An alternative, avoiding the use of arbitrary prior information, is the Bayesian Lasso (BL). Regular BL uses a common variance parameter for residual and SNP effects (BL1Var). We propose here a BL with different residual and SNP effect variances (BL2Var), equivalent to the original Lasso formulation. The λ parameter in Lasso is related to genetic variation in the population. We also suggest precomputing individual variances of SNP effects by BL2Var, to be later used in a linear mixed model (HetVar-GBLUP). Models were tested in a cross-validation design including 1756 Holstein and 678 Montbéliarde French bulls, with 1216 and 451 bulls used as training data; 51 325 and 49 625 polymorphic SNP were used. Milk production traits were tested. Other methods tested included linear mixed models using variances inferred from pedigree estimates or integrated out from the data. Estimates of genetic variation in the population were close to pedigree estimates in BL2Var but not in BL1Var. BL1Var shrank breeding values too little because of the common variance. BL2Var was the most accurate method for prediction and accommodated well major genes, in particular for fat percentage. BL1Var was the least accurate. HetVar-GBLUP was almost as accurate as BL2Var and allows for simple computations and extensions.
