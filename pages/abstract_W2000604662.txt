Abstract Although Ca2+-dependent exocytosis is considered to be a pathway for gliotransmitter release from astrocytes, the structural and functional bases of this process remain controversial. We studied the relationship between near-membrane Ca2+ elevations and the dynamics of single astroglial vesicles with styryl (FM) dyes. We show that cultured astrocytes, unlike neurons, spontaneously internalize FM dyes, resulting in the labeling of the entire acidic vesicle population within minutes. Interestingly, metabotropic glutamate receptor activation did not affect the FM labeling. Most FM-stained vesicles expressed sialin, CD63/LAMP3, and VAMP7, three markers for lysosomes and late endosomes. A subset of lysosomes underwent asynchronous exocytosis that required both Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores and Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane. Lysosomal fusion occurred within seconds and was complete with no evidence for kiss and run. Our experiments suggest that astroglial Ca2+-regulated exocytosis is carried by lysosomes and operates on a timescale orders of magnitude slower than synaptic transmission.gliavesicle releaseintracellular signalingtotal internal reflection fluorescence microscopyTIRFkiss and runreadily releasable pool
