An ethnobotanical survey was conducted among herbalists in the north-central region of Morocco using a questionnaire in order to highlight knowledge and know-how and to establish an inventory of herbal remedies used in the treatment of diseases common in the region and rarely cited in the bibliography: in this case, it is insomnia, asthenia, and oral-gum infections. The results showed that 120 herbalists were interviewed in different areas of the Fez-Meknes region, about 86 species were cited and grouped into 60 families (47 plants to treat asthenia, 25 to treat insomnia, and 21 to treat oral and gum infections). The reported plants have been identified and presented with the binomial name, family, part used, and method of preparation. In addition, the versatility was observed in several plants, indicating that the same plant could be used to treat conditions of different groups. Herbalists are people of both sexes belonging to different age groups and have different socioeconomic and intellectual levels. Eighty percent of surveyed herbalists are willing to provide us information about plants in the studied area. The most cited plants for treating these diseases are Lavandula dentata, Matricaria chamomilla, Rosmarinus officinalis, Allium cepa, Origanum vulgare, Origanum majorana, Marrubium vulgare, Lepidium sativum, and Ocimum basilicum. The Lamiaceae are the most quoted family. The leaves are the most commonly used organs. Infusion is the most common form of preparation. The results of this ethnobotanical study could constitute an important source of information and databases for further research in the fields of phytochemistry and pharmacology in order to find new bioactive molecules. In addition, this document can be used in the protection of indigenous knowledge.
