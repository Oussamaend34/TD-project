Pseudomonas isolates have frequently been isolated from the rhizosphere of plants, and several of them have been reported as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria. In the present work, tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) seeds were germinated in greenhouse conditions, and the seedling height, length of plants, collar diameter and number of leaves were measured from plants grown in soil inoculated by bacterial isolates. Pseudomonas isolates were isolated from the rhizosphere. We used the Newman-Keuls test to ascertain pairwise differences. Isolates were identified as a new Pseudomonas species by rpoD gene sequencing. The results showed that isolates of Pseudomonas sp. (Q6B) increased seed germination (P = 0.01); Pseudomonas sp. (Q6B, Q14B, Q7B, Q1B and Q13B) also promoted seedling height (P = 0.01). All five isolates promoted plant length and enlarged the collar diameter (P = 0.01). Pseudomonas sp. (Q1B) also increased leaf number (P = 0.01). The investigation found that Pseudomonas isolates were able to solubilize phosphate, produce siderophores, ammonia, and indole-3-acetic acid and colonize the roots of tomato plants. This study shows that these five novel Pseudomonas sp. isolates can be effective new plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria.
