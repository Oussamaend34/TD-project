Brain tumors, a severe health concern across all age groups, present challenges for accurate grading in health monitoring and automated diagnosis. Choosing MRI scans for their superior quality and comprehensive anatomical insight, this study navigates the complexities of brain tumor classification. Deep learning (DL) algorithms revolutionize this field, empowering radiologists with enhanced diagnostic precision. Despite the pivotal role of extensive training data in DL success, medical image datasets often suffer from limitations in diversity and quantity. Transfer learning emerges as a solution, bridging gaps between similar yet distinct areas. The inadequacy of general pre-trained models on ImageNet for medical imaging characteristics prompts our recommendation for RadImageNet. This tailored solution aligns pre-trained models with the specific demands of medical imaging datasets, addressing the current mismatch. Our dataset includes 7023 MR images of Normal brain, Glioma, Meningioma, and Pituitary tumors. We employ two approaches: 'Feature Ensemble,' combining 2-top features, and 'Stacking Ensemble,' utilizing SVM, k-NN, Extra Trees, and MLP as base learners, and Logistic Regression (LR) as a meta-learner. In our initial approach with ResNet-50 and DenseNet121 features guided by MLP, we attained an impressive 97.71% accuracy and a remarkable Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 99.87%. Shifting to the Stacking Ensemble method, where DenseNet121 serves as the optimal feature extractor, we secured a commendable 97.40% accuracy, accompanied by an exceptional AUC of 99.83%. These outcomes highlight the efficacy of our ensemble learning strategies in enhancing both accuracy and the overall discriminative power of the model.
