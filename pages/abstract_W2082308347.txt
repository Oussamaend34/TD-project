Essential oil of aerial parts of Salvia aucheri Boiss. var. mesatlantica was obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC and GC/MS. The oil was predominated by camphor (49.59%). The inhibitory effect of this essential oil was estimated on the corrosion of steel in 0.5 M H2SO4 using electrochemical polarization and weight loss measurements. The corrosion rate of steel is decreased in the presence of natural oil. The inhibition efficiency was found to increase with oil content to attain 86.12% at 2 g/L. Polarization curves revealed that the oil of S. aucheri mesatlantica acts as mixed type inhibitor with a strong predominance of anodic character. The temperature effect on the corrosion behavior of steel in 0.5 M H2SO4 without and with the inhibitor at 2 g/L was studied in the temperature range from 303 to 343 K, the associated activation energy have been determined. The adsorption of oil on the steel surface was found to obey Langmuir’s adsorption isotherm.
