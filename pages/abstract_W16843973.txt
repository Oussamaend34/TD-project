The transcription of the tobacco Tnt1 retrotransposon was previously shown to be induced, in tobacco and in heterologous species, by microbial elicitors and by pathogen infections. We report here that the expression of the Tnt1 promoter is also activated in heterologous species such as tomato and Arabidopsis by wounding, freezing and by other abiotic factors known to induce the plant defence response, such as salicylic acid, CuCl2, or oxidative stress. A similar regulation is observed in tobacco for most treatments. The induction of the Tnt1 promoter expression by wounding remains localized around injury points. In CuCl2-treated Arabidopsis plants, the transcription of Tnt1 is correlated with accumulation of the phytoalexin camalexin and with the expression of the EL13 defence gene. The interest of the Tnt1 promoter as a sensitive indicator of the plant defence responses is discussed.
