Rhizobia inoculants have contributed to increase N2 fixation and yield in legumes crops. However, most of the inoculants produced world-wide are of poor or suboptimal quality. We discuss here why some of them are poor products and how to improve their quality and efficacy. Reported data on the inoculation rate effect can be used to design good inoculants. Technologies are now available to produce inoculants with a shelf-life of more than 1 year. Available quality control methods can help to improve the quality of inoculants although they do not take into account the physiological satus of the rhizobia. Unfortunately quality control is not commonly used except in major inoculant companies and the quality of inoculants sold on the market is low. The need for an increase in quality standards is discussed especially for the number of rhizobia delivered per seed and for the presence of contaminants. Some new technologies which able to increase efficacy and reliability of inoculation are discussed.
