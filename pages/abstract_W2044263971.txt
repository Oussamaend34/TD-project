In walnut (Juglans regia L.), an otherwise difficult-to-root species, explants of cotyledons have been shown to generate complete roots in the absence of exogenous growth regulators. In the present study, this process of root formation was shown to follow a pattern of adventitious, rather than primary or lateral, ontogeny: (i) the arrangement of vascular bundles in the region of root formation was of the petiole type; (ii) a typical root primordium was formed at the side of the procambium within a meristematic ring of actively dividing cells located around each vascular bundle; (iii) the developing root apical meristem was connected in a lateral way with the vascular bundle of the petiole. This adventitious root formation occurred in three main stages of cell division, primordium formation and organization of apical meristem. These stages were characterized by expression of LATERAL ROOT PRIMORDIUM-1 and CHALCONE SYNTHASE genes, which were found to be sequentially expressed during the formation of the primordium. Activation of genes related to root cell differentiation started at the early stage of primordium formation prior to organization of the root apical meristem. The systematic development of adventitious root primordia at a precise site gave indications on the positional and biochemical cues that are necessary for adventitious root formation.
