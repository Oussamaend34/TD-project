Genetic control of the different attributes involved in peach quality has been investigated in an advanced backcross population derived from a cross between Prunus davidiana clone P1908, a wild parent with poor agronomic performance, and a commercial variety, Summergrand. A total of 24 physical and biochemical traits were investigated. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were detected for all the traits studied. We identified alleles from P. davidiana with agronomically favorable effects regarding fruit and stone sizes, sugar and acid concentrations and red flesh coloration, in clear contrast to its phenotype. We identified three main regions of the genome where alleles from P. davidiana had negative effects on multiple traits. In other regions, co-locations of QTLs with opposite effects on quality traits were also detected. We discuss the nature of these co-locations in the light of the probable physiological mechanisms involved. Strategies to cope with negative correlations between favorable traits and co-locations of P. davidiana alleles with negative effects on quality traits and positive effects regarding resistance to powdery mildew are discussed from a breeding point of view.
