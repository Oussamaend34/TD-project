Syzygium aromaticum L. is a popular flavor and fragrance spice used in cooking, traditional and modern therapy. No work has compared between the scavenging capacity of the essential oil, extracts and eugenol, or studied that of the hexane extract, as well as its phenolic and flavonoid contents. To reveal more details on phytochemical and scavenging characteristics of Syzygium aromaticum spice, we estimated the scavenging activity of the essential oil, each extract of water, ethanol, ethyl acetate and hexane obtained from clove buds, based on their effective concentration able to scavenge 50% (EC50) of 2,2′-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, and 2,2′-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt free radicals. The essential oil showed high scavenging activity (EC50 of 0.40 ± 0.06 and 0.42 ± 0.02 mg/ml), and comprises 13 identified compounds. Eugenol, β-Caryophyllene, eugenyl acetate and α-Humulene are the major components. Comparing extracts, those of ethanol and hexane exhibited the greatest phenolic content (351.83 ± 17.90 and 348.04 ± 24.54 mg of gallic acid equivalent/gextract respectively) and the potent scavenging activities (EC50 of 0.41 ± 0.03 and 0.37 ± 0.00 mg/ml respectively). A moderate flavonoid content was observed, and aqueous extract was the best (21.90 ± 0.16 mg of quercetin equivalent/gextract). According to thin layer chromatography screening, all extracts content eugenol except that of water, this phenol contributes mainly on the scavenging activity and seems to be more active in mixture with terpenes, like in essential oil.
