The performance of copper selenide and effectiveness of chemical catalytic reactors are dependent on an inclined magnetic field, the nature of the chemical reaction, introduction of space heat source, changes in both distributions of temperature and concentration of nanofluids. This report presents the significance of increasing radius of nanoparticles, energy flux due to the concentration gradient, and mass flux due to the temperature gradient in the dynamics of the fluid subject to inclined magnetic strength is presented. The non-dimensionalization and parameterization of the dimensional governing equation were obtained by introducing suitable similarity variables. Thereafter, the numerical solutions were obtained through shooting techniques together with 4th order Runge–Kutta Scheme and MATLAB in-built bvp4c package. It was concluded that at all the levels of energy flux due to concentration gradient, reduction in the viscosity of water-based nanofluid due to a higher radius of copper nanoparticles causes an enhancement of the velocity. The emergence of both energy flux and mass flux due to gradients in concentration and temperature affect the distribution of temperature and concentration at the free stream.
