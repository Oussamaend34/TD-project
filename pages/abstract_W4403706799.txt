By employing a synergistic blend of experimental and theoretical methodologies, we investigated the corrosion inhibition efficacy of a synthesized pyrazole derivative (BM-01) in a solution of hydrochloric acid (1M). We utilized molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), density functional theory (DFT), complexation, plus electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). We conducted weight loss (WL) measurements from 298 to 328K. Inhibition efficacy reached a maximum at a BM-01 concentration of 10−3M, achieving 90.0% (EIS), 90.40% (WL), and 90.38% (potentiodynamic polarization (PDP)). SEM unveiled the shielding of the carbon-steel surface from acid-induced damage by BM-01. The Langmuir adsorption isotherm exhibited a robust fit with a low sum of squares, standard deviation, and a high correlation coefficient. PDP findings indicated that BM-01 acted as a mixed-type inhibitor, predominantly favoring the cathodic process, suggesting potential corrosion-mitigation properties. Theoretical analyses involving DFT, MD simulations, and radial distribution function were conducted to postulate a mechanism and identify an inhibitory layer. Theoretical outcomes aligned closely with experimental data, thereby reinforcing the validity of our findings.
