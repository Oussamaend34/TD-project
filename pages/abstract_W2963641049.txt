This paper deals with the adsorption of an anionic dye, Eriochrome Black T (EBT), from aqueous solutions onto sawdust, which is a natural, eco-friendly, widespread, and a low-cost bio sorbent. The aim of the work is to append values to the wood industry waste. Thus, sawdust was used as adsorbent in both batch reactor (BR) and fixed bed column (FBC), and various operating parameters influencing the adsorption process were investigated. The kinetic and the equilibrium adsorption results were found to agree with, respectively, the prediction of the pseudo-second-order equation and the Langmuir model. This latter allowed also the determination of the maximum EBT dye adsorbed amount, which was found to be about 40.96 mg EBT per gram of sawdust at pH = 4, corresponding to % dye removal of about 80%. In addition, the influence of various parameters on the dye adsorption, such as the adsorbent dose, the aqueous phase pH, and the initial dye concentration, was also examined. In batch experiments, The EBT adsorbed amount was found to increase either by increasing the amount of sawdust or by decreasing the aqueous phase pH, whereas, in the fixed bed column, the EBT retention was found to increase by decreasing the flow rate of the dye through the column. The overall data indicate that the EBT adsorption is mainly governed by the electrostatic interactions occurring between the adsorbent material and the dye.
