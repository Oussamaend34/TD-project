Abstract In this paper, a compact, wideband, printed antenna is proposed for millimeter-wave fifth-generation communication systems. The proposed design is a patch antenna with a defected ground structure, in which ground plane defects are utilized to reduce resonance and achieve wideband operation. The optimized antenna dimensions are 2.5 mm × 4.5 mm with a substrate thickness of 0.203 mm. A prototype antenna was fabricated and measured to verify the performance, and it was established that the simulated and measured results were in good agreement. The measured bandwidth was approximately 6.4 GHz (26.5–32.9 GHz) with a peak gain of 5.62 dBi and an efficiency in operational bandwidth of 84%. The compactness, wide bandwidth, and decent gain suggest that the proposed antenna is a potential contender for forthcoming communication systems.
