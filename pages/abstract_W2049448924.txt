The effect of the defects on magnetic properties of a bilayer Ising ferromagnetic antiferromagnetic model is studied by Monte Carlo simulations, for a nano-graphene lattice with spins that can take the values σ=3/2 and S=5/2. We consider two ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic bilayers with N=42 spins, with a random number of defects. We only consider the nearest-neighbor interactions between the site i and j on each layer. The effects of the defects on magnetization are investigated for fixed temperature, crystal field, and magnetic field values. The thermal dependency of each layer magnetization is calculated for fixed defect rate values K 3 and K 5, the crystal field, and external magnetic field. The magnetization hysteresis loops for several rate defects are also investigated as a function of the external magnetic field.
