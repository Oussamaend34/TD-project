We consider a novel fractional model to investigates the (tuberculosis) TB model dynamics with two age groups of human, that is, the children and the adults. First, we formulate the model and present the basic results associated to the model. Then, using the fractional operators, Caputo and the Atangana-Baleanu and obtain a generalized model. Further, we give a novel numerical approach for the solution of the fractional model and obtain their approximate solution. We show graphical results with various values of the fractional order. A comparison of the two operators are shown graphically. The results obtained through Atangana-Baleanu operator is flexible than that of Caputo derivative. The infection in tuberculosis (TB) infected people decreases fast when decreasing the fractional order.
