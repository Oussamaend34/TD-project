Worldwide, arsenic contamination has become a matter of extreme importance owing to its potential toxic, carcinogenic and mutagenic impact on human health and the environment. The magnetite-loaded biochar has received increasing attention for the removal of arsenic (As) in contaminated water and soil. The present study reports a facile synthesis, characterization and adsorption characteristics of a novel magnetite impregnated nitrogen-doped hybrid biochar (N/Fe3O4@BC) for efficient arsenate, As(V) and arsenite, As(III) removal from aqueous environment. The as-synthesized material (N/Fe3O4@BC) characterization via XRD, BET, FTIR, SEM/EDS clearly revealed magnetite (Fe3O4) impregnation onto biochar matrix. Furthermore, the adsorbent (N/Fe3O4@BC) selectivity results showed that such a combination plays an important role in targeted molecule removal from aqueous environments and compensates for the reduced surface area. The maximum monolayer adsorption (Qmax) of developed adsorbent (N/Fe3O4@BC) (18.15 mg/g and 9.87 mg/g) was significantly higher than that of pristine biochar (BC) (9.89 & 8.12 mg/g) and magnetite nano-particles (MNPs) [7.38 & 8.56 mg/g] for both As(III) and As(V), respectively. Isotherm and kinetic data were well fitted by Langmuir (R2 = 0.993) and Pseudo first order model (R2 = 0.992) thereby indicating physico-chemical sorption as a rate-limiting step. The co-anions (PO43-) effect was more significant for both As(III) and As (V) removal owing to similar outer electronic structure. Mechanistic insights (pH and FTIR spectra) further demonstrated the remarkable contribution of surface groups (OH–, –NH2 and –COOH), electrostatic attraction (via H- bonds), surface complexation and ion exchange followed by external mass transfer diffusion and As(III) oxidation into As(V) by (N/Fe3O4@BC) reactive oxygen species. Moreover, successful desorption was achieved at varying rates up to 7th regeneration cycle thereby showing (N/Fe3O4@BC) potential practical application. Thus, this work provides a novel insight for the fabrication of novel magnetic biochar for As removal from contaminated water in natural, engineering and environmental settings.
