Dynamic management has been proposed as a complementary strategy to gene banks for the conservation of genetic resources. The evolution of frequencies of genes for specific resistance towards powdery mildew (caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici) in populations of a French network for dynamic management of bread wheat genetic resources was investigated after 10 years of multiplication without human selection. The objective was to determine whether specific resistance gene diversity was maintained in the populations and whether any changes could be attributed to selection due to pathogen pressure. Seven populations, originating from four of the network sites, were characterized and compared to the initial population for six specific resistance gene frequencies detected by nine Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici isolates. Diversity decreased at the population level, but because of a strong differentiation between the populations, this diversity was maintained at the network level. The comparison of Fst parameters estimated on neutral markers (RFLP) and on resistance gene data revealed that in two of the populations specific resistance genes had been selected by pathogen pressure, whereas evolution in two other populations seemed to be the result of genetic drift. For the three last populations, conclusions were less clear, as one had probably experienced a strong bottleneck and the other two presented intermediate Fst values. A dynamic management network with sites contrasted for pathogen pressure, allowing genetic drift in some populations and selection in others, appeared, at least on the short term, to be a good tool for maintaining the diversity of genes for specific resistance to powdery mildew.
