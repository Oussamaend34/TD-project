Nowadays, inspired by the great success of Transformers in Natural Language Processing, many applications of Vision Transformers (ViTs) have been investigated in the field of medical image analysis including breast ultrasound (BUS) image segmentation and classification. In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-task framework to segment and classify tumors in BUS images using hybrid convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-ViTs architecture and Multi-Perceptron (MLP)-Mixer. The proposed method uses a two-encoder architecture with EfficientNetV2 backbone and an adapted ViT encoder to extract tumor regions in BUS images. The self-attention (SA) mechanism in the Transformer encoder allows capturing a wide range of high-level and complex features while the EfficientNetV2 encoder preserves local information in image. To fusion the extracted features, a Channel Attention Fusion (CAF) module is introduced. The CAF module selectively emphasizes important features from both encoders, improving the integration of high-level and local information. The resulting feature maps are reconstructed to obtain the segmentation maps using a decoder. Then, our method classifies the segmented tumor regions into benign and malignant using a simple and efficient classifier based on MLP-Mixer, that is applied for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, for the task of lesion classification in BUS images. Experimental results illustrate the outperformance of our framework compared to recent works for the task of segmentation by producing 83.42% in terms of Dice coefficient as well as for the classification with 86% in terms of accuracy.
