Clubroot, caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae, is one of the most damaging diseases of vegetable Brassica crops in the world. In this study, genetic control and mapping of loci implied in quantitative resistance against five isolates of P. brassicae were studied in the F1 and F2/3 progenies of the cross C10 (resistant kale)×HDEM (susceptible broccoli). A genetic map was constructed using RFLP, random and specific PCR-based markers. The 199 loci were assembled into nine linkage groups covering 1,226.3 cM. The F3 families were assessed for resistance under controlled conditions with four single-spore isolates and one field isolate. A total of nine genomic regions were detected for clubroot resistance. Depending on the isolate, two to five QTLs were identified. The total phenotypic variation accounted for by QTLs ranged from 70% to 88% depending on the isolate. One of the QTLs (Pb-Bo1) was detected in all isolates and explained 20.7–80.7% of the phenotypic variation. Pb-Bo1 had a major effect on three isolates but this effect was weaker for the last two. Five QTLs with minor effect were identified in only one isolate. To construct clubroot resistant varieties, the existence of both broad-spectrum and isolate-specific QTLs should be taken into account for the choice of genomic regions to use in a marker-assisted selection strategy.
