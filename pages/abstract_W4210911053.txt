The toxicity of the textile industry’s discharges is a major concern for all authorities around the world as it negatively affects water quality and human health. In this regard, this study aims to prepare two innovative materials based on walnut shells (WS) and peanut shells (PS) as two promising, low-cost, and environmentally friendly bio-adsorbents to remove the toxic dye methylene blue (MB) in an aqueous solution. The surface morphological and functional properties of WS and PS materials were characterized by FTIR, SEM-EDX, and pHpzc to predict the likely adsorption mechanism. The performance of the adsorption method and the high selectivity of the two materials leads to a remarkable competition between the MB dye and different ions from pH variation and metal salts. The optimum adsorption capacity was 101.43 mg g−1 and 67.42 mg g−1 on treated walnut shells (TWS) and treated peanut shells (TPS), respectively, for 60 mg L−1 as the initial concentration of MB, particle size = 90 μm, pH 6 at a temperature of 20 °C and 0.5 g L−1 of the adsorbent. The adsorption experimental data followed Langmuir’s isotherm and Pseudo-second-order’s kinetic model. The thermodynamic parameters of MB adsorption on TWS and TPS show that the process is physical, endothermic, and spontaneous. In addition to the regeneration capacity, the overall cost of the adsorption process for one liter of methylene blue dye was $0.6968 with walnut shells and $0.6965 with peanut shells, showing the technology’s economic viability and eco-industrial potential. In addition, the reuse of inexpensive adsorbents explains the importance of economic, environmental, and regenerative aspects of biomaterials.
