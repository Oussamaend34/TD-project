Present communication aims to determine the impact of Cattaneo–Christov model and convective boundary on second-grade nanofluid flow alongside a Riga pattern. Zero mass flux is accounted at the solid surface of Riga pattern such that the fraction of nanoparticles maintains itself on strong retardation. The impact of Lorentz forces generated by Riga pate is also an important aspect of the study. The governing nonlinear problem is converted into ordinary problems via suitably adjusted transformations. Spectral local linearization method has been incorporated to find the solutions of the nonlinear problems. Variation in horizontal movement of the nanofluid, thermal distribution and concentration distribution of the nanoparticles has been noted for various fluid parameters. The results are plotted graphically. Outcomes indicate that the horizontal movement gains enhancement for elevated values of modified Hartman factor. Thermal state of the nanofluid and concentration of nanoparticles receive reduction for incremental values of relaxation time parameters. Numerical results for skin friction and heat flux have been reported in tabular form. The CPU run time and residual error are obtained to check the efficiency of the method used for finding the solution.
