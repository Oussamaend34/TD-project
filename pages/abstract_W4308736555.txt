Land-Use and Land-Cover (LULC) mapping is relevant for many applications, from Earth system and climate modelling to territorial and urban planning. Global LULC products are continuously developing as remote sensing data and methods grow. However, there still exists low consistency among LULC products due to low accuracy in some regions and LULC types. Here, we introduce Sentinel2GlobalLULC, a Sentinel-2 RGB image dataset, built from the spatial-temporal consensus of up to 15 global LULC maps available in Google Earth Engine. Sentinel2GlobalLULC v2.1 contains 194877 single-class RGB image tiles organized into 29 LULC classes. Each image is a 224 × 224 pixels tile at 10 × 10 m resolution built as a cloud-free composite from Sentinel-2 images acquired between June 2015 and October 2020. Metadata includes a unique LULC annotation per image, together with level of consensus, reverse geo-referencing, global human modification index, and number of dates used in the composite. Sentinel2GlobalLULC is designed for training deep learning models aiming to build precise and robust global or regional LULC maps.
