Abstract The copper(I) catalyzed azide–alkyne [3 + 2] cycloaddition (32CA) reaction and its uncatalyzed version have been studied for systematic understanding of this relevant organic transformation, using DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) (LANL2DZ for Cu) computational levels. In the absence of a copper(I) catalyst, two regioisomeric reaction paths were studied, indicating that the 32CA reaction takes place through an asynchronous one-step mechanism with a very low polar character. The two reactive channels leading to 1,4- and 1,5-regisomer present similar high activation energies of 18.84 and 18.51 kcal mol−1, respectively. The coordination of copper(I) to alkyne produces relevant changes in this 32CA reaction. Analysis of the global and local electrophilicity/nucleophilicity allows explaining correctly the behaviors of the copper(I) catalyzed cycloaddition. Coordination of the copper to alkyne changes the mechanism from a non-polar one-step mechanism to a polar stepwise one, as a consequence of the high nucleophilic character of the dinuclear Cu(I)-acetylide complex. Parr and Fukui functions and Dual Descriptor correctly explain the observed regioselectivity by means of the most favorable two-center interaction that takes place along the 1,4 reaction path.
