Chemical preservatives in the food industry have recently attracted significant attention due to the growing consumer awareness of the associated risks. This has resulted in an increased demand for organic alternatives that enhance food preservation and extend the shelf life of perishable products. The shift in consumer preferences is driven by concerns over potential health hazards from chemical substances and the desire for more nutritious, longer-lasting food options. The objective is to reduce the incidence of foodborne diseases, which pose threats to consumers, food companies, and regulatory agencies. This review aims to enumerate various natural agents with antimicrobial and antioxidant properties, focusing on recent studies. It investigates natural preservatives derived from plants, animals, and microorganisms, including underutilized sources, to identify novel substances from food industry byproducts that can potentially be used as natural food preservatives. Additionally, the review explores the increasing importance of novel technologies in food preservation, specifically focusing on nanoemulsions, nanoparticles, nanocomposites, and microencapsulation. These technologies utilize the bioactivity of natural compounds to enhance stability, enable controlled release, and improve effectiveness in preventing microbial growth and oxidative deterioration in food systems. Furthermore, the review highlights the importance of edible coatings as an emerging method for food preservation. This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of using natural resources to develop safe, eco-friendly preservatives that satisfy both industry and consumer demands. These findings pave the way for further research and broader utilization of natural substances in food preservation. Graphical Abstract
