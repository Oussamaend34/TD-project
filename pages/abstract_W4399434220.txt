Abstract This study examines the intricate dynamics of patent valorization within Moroccan higher education institutions, highlighting a pronounced contrast between the efficiency of patent generation and the inherent challenges in their commercial exploitation. Leveraging a qualitative methodology, particularly through in-depth interviews with key stakeholders involved in the patent valorization process within public universities, the research uncovers the primary obstacles that impede the transformation of university patents into marketable innovations. These obstacles include a lack of specifically allocated funding for post-patent development phases, a deficiency in marketing and entrepreneurship skills among academic staff, limited interactions with the industry, and a regulatory framework perceived as restrictive. Based on these observations, we propose a set of strategic recommendations on two levels: national and university. Nationally, we recommend the establishment of dedicated valorization funds to finance key commercialization phases, a substantial revision of the regulatory framework to simplify and encourage the valorization process, and the implementation of incentive mechanisms to strengthen collaborations between universities and the industrial sector. Within university settings, it is crucial to integrate specialized training programs for researchers and valorization managers focused on intellectual property management and technology transfer, and to bolster existing valorization structures. These structures should be equipped with the necessary resources to efficiently identify and support patentable innovations. Furthermore, it is advised to promote the creation of incubators and accelerators within universities to support innovative startups emerging from academic research. The ultimate aim of this contribution is to provide strategic guidance for enhancing the effectiveness of university patent valorization, thereby fostering innovation and contributing to Morocco's economic development
