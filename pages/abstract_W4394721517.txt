The remarkable characteristics of hybrid nanofluids, including enhanced heat transfer rates, attractive thermal conductivity, and cost-effectiveness, have garnered significant attention from researchers worldwide. This numerical analysis focuses on investigating the impact of velocity slip in the radiative hybrid nanofluid (Cu–TiO2/water) flow over a curved sheet. Additionally, the study explores thermal slip in the boundary layer flow in the presence of viscous dissipation. The bvp4c method, implemented through MATLAB software, is utilized for obtaining mathematical results. The influence of various governing parameters on virtual flow properties, velocity, and temperature is examined, with the results presented graphically. Key quantities such as wall shear stress and heat transfer coefficient are calculated, and the outcomes are tabulated and graphically represented. The findings highlight the thermal behavior of the system, indicating an enhancement in the presence of nanoparticles, thermal radiation, and viscous dissipation. Moreover, the fluid velocity increases with greater curvature effects. These insights hold potential applications in engineering and materials science.
