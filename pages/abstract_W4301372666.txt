Improving the thermal performance of cooling systems is crucial for energy and raw material savings, increasing the thermal ratings, and extending the work life of various equipment. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of experimental and numerical research on natural convection heat transfer and fluid flow in heat sinks. This review presents the characteristics and capabilities of various feasible cooling strategies, including new methods and advanced solutions. The many research that have paid attention to the parametric study of the geometry of the heat sink are extensively discussed Key parameters with a significant impact on the heat sink’s design and performance are thoroughly discussed, including the effects of operating conditions and geometric parameters of working fluids (i.e., effect of magnetic field, use of nanofluids, etc.), and the use of phase change materials. Correlations for estimating natural convection heat transfer rates as a relation of key parameters (spacing, height, orientations) are provided and detailed. Finally, the study highlights the important points and research gaps to provide better insight and valuable guidance for researchers who intend to study, improve, or optimize any type of heat sink for different applications.
