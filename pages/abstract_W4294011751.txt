Phosphorus (P) is fundamental to all life forms and considered a major limiting factor for plant growth. However, soils remain inherently poor in available P content as P can be lost from the soil–plant cycling system. Hence, modern agriculture has become dependent on regular inputs of phosphate to achieve high outputs and ensure food security. The use of mineral P fertilizers manufactured from mined rock phosphate (RP) has led to an open P cycle that has given rise to serious ecological concerns. Given the non-renewable nature of P reserves, scientists have debated over the longevity of the remaining RP deposits and their future viability to produce enough food to feed an ever-growing population. This review provides an updated synthesis of sustainable management strategies for closing the P cycle by exploring cost-effective and eco-friendly alternatives. Numerous agronomic practices and technical solutions have been developed including industrial P recovery and better management of soil microbial communities. Other studies have also focused on addressing global RP reserves and demand of a careful examination of its usage. However, despite the promising results obtained at pilot scale, the field-scale implementation remains a challenging task ahead of scientists to ensure global food security, with economical cost, and minimum environmental impact.
