Our objective in this work consists in the synthesis, the characterization, the elaboration, the formulation, and the rheological study of the new phosphoric epoxy resin: pentaglycidyl ether pentaphenoxy of phosphorus (PGEPPP). Thus, we identified this polymer by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Then, its chemical structure was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance of proton (1H NMR) and carbon (13C NMR). Furthermore, the rheological analyzes of the epoxy resin and their composite (PGEPPP/MDA/PN) were determined by the RHM01-RD HAAKE rheometer. Moreover, this epoxy polymer and their composite have been applied in flow phenomena and implementation. Finally, we proceeded to the morphological of the composite (PGEPPP/MDA/PN) using the scanning electron microscope, in order to confirm the dispersion of the natural phosphate load incorporated into the prepared composite.
