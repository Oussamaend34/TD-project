Vehicle identification systems are vital components that enable many aspects of contemporary life, such as safety, trade, transit, and law enforcement. They improve community and individual well-being by increasing vehicle management, security, and transparency. These tasks entail locating and extracting license plates from images or video frames using computer vision and machine learning techniques, followed by recognizing the letters or digits on the plates. This paper proposes a new license plate detection and recognition method based on the deep learning YOLO v8 method, image processing techniques, and the OCR technique for text recognition. For this, the first step was the dataset creation, when gathering 270 images from the internet. Afterward, CVAT (Computer Vision Annotation Tool) was used to annotate the dataset, which is an open-source software platform made to make computer vision tasks easier to annotate and label images and videos. Subsequently, the newly released Yolo version, the Yolo v8, has been employed to detect the number plate area in the input image. Subsequently, after extracting the plate the k-means clustering algorithm, the thresholding techniques, and the opening morphological operation were used to enhance the image and make the characters in the license plate clearer before using OCR. The next step in this process is using the OCR technique to extract the characters. Eventually, a text file containing only the character reflecting the vehicle's country is generated. To ameliorate the efficiency of the proposed approach, several metrics were employed, namely precision, recall, F1-Score, and CLA. In addition, a comparison of the proposed method with existing techniques in the literature has been given. The suggested method obtained convincing results in both detection as well as recognition by obtaining an accuracy of 99% in detection and 98% in character recognition.
