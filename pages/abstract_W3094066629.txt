The current paper investigates the impact of a turbulent atmosphere on the propagation of a partially coherent Generalized Flattened Hermite Cosh-Gaussian (GFHChG) beam. The evaluation of a theoretical expression of the average intensity distribution for the partially coherent GFHChG beam is based on the extended Huygens-Fresnel diffraction integral and the Rytov’s quadratic approximation. The results of some laser beams are deduced as special cases from the present work. The behavior of the studied beam which is propagating through a turbulent atmosphere is analyzed through numerical illustrations. Results indicate that the partially coherent GFHChG beam successively changes shape from a doughnut to a flattened then to a Gaussian profile during its propagation in a turbulent atmosphere.
