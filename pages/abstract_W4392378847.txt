Abstract In this work, we studied the magnetic properties and hysteresis behavior of the ferromagnetic spin-3/2 Blume–Capel model with a transverse crystal field in a graphene monolayer. For this purpose, the mean-field approximation based on the Gibbs–Bogoliubov inequality for the free energy was used. We examined the effects of some physical parameters of the system, namely, the longitudinal and transverse crystal fields, external magnetic field, and temperature on the magnetization behavior, phase diagrams, and hysteresis loops. Very important results were obtained, such as the emergence of first- and second-order phase transitions, multicritical points, zero-temperature highly degenerate points, and multi-loop hysteresis behavior.
