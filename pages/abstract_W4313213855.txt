Abstract In the last decade, healthcare systems have played an effective role in improving medical services by monitoring and diagnosing patients' health remotely. These systems, either in hospitals or in other health centers, have experienced significant growth with emerging technologies. They are becoming of great interest to many countries worldwide nowadays. Portable healthcare monitoring systems (HMS) depend on internet of things (IoT) technology due to its effectiveness and reliability in several sectors, as well as in the sector of telemedicine. This paper proposes a portable healthcare system in an IoT environment controllable via a smartphone application that aims to facilitate utilization. This proposed system can track physiological indicators of a patient's body as well as the environmental conditions where the patient lives in real-time and auto-manage databases. Moreover, this paper touched on a comparison between three servers, concerning data transfer speeds from the proposed system into the servers.
