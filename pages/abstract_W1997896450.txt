Vesicular glutamate transporters are expressed not only in glutamate neurons but also in monoamine, acetylcholine and, intriguingly, GABA neurons. Trudeau and colleagues discuss the role of these transporters in glutamate co-release and vesicular synergy — a process leading to enhanced packaging of the 'primary' transmitter. Recent data indicate that 'classical' neurotransmitters can also act as co-transmitters. This notion has been strengthened by the demonstration that three vesicular glutamate transporters (vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1), VGLUT2 and VGLUT3) are present in central monoamine, acetylcholine and GABA neurons, as well as in primarily glutamatergic neurons. Thus, intriguing questions are raised about the morphological and functional organization of neuronal systems endowed with such a dual signalling capacity. In addition to glutamate co-release, vesicular synergy — a process leading to enhanced packaging of the 'primary' transmitter — is increasingly recognized as a major property of the glutamatergic co-phenotype. The behavioural relevance of this co-phenotype is presently the focus of considerable interest.
