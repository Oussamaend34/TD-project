Human visceral leishmaniasis has long been associated with canine leishmaniasis (CL). However, to date, there is no clear information on the status of the disease in dogs in Morocco that could be used by policymakers for the prevention of human cases. This study aims to assess the status of CL in Morocco and its risk factors through an exhaustive literature search. The meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4. The main results showed that the overall prevalence of CL in Morocco is 17% (95% CI: 0.12–0.22), caused by two strains of Leishmania parasite: Leishmania tropica and L. infantum. According to the region, the maximum prevalence was reported in the coastal provinces and in the central part of the country; while, the CL risk was higher in rural area (18% [95% CI: 0.14–0.23]) and at altitude above 1000 m (23% [95% CI: − 0.08–0.53]). Regarding the intrinsic factors, the prevalence of the disease increased with the age of the dog, (30% [95% CI − 0.09–0.68) and the risk was very high in clinically asymptomatic dogs (RR = 2.08 [95% CI: 1.15–3.76]). This study is the first in Morocco indicating the CL prevalence, its geographical distribution and detailing its risk factors. These results are needed to improve management strategies for the canine reservoir of leishmaniasis in Morocco and interrupt the local transmission cycle to humans.
