In this paper, we study the effect of turbulent atmosphere for a new type of Bessel-like beams family by considering a generalized spiraling Bessel beam (GSBB) created by illuminating a curved fork-shaped hologram with a Laguerre–Gaussian beam. Based on the extended Huygens–Fresnel integral formula in the paraxial approximation, by means of the Rytov method and using the expression of the hard aperture function into a finite sum of complex Gaussian functions, an analytical expression of the on-axis average intensity for the considered beams family is derived. Some numerical simulations for the GSBB propagating in atmospheric turbulence are given and discussed by studying the influences of some factors as the beam topological charge, the beam waist, the wavelength and the turbulent strength.
