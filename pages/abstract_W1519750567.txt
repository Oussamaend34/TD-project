Grain yield and grain protein content are two very important traits in bread wheat. They are controlled by genetic factors, but environmental conditions considerably affect their expression. The aim of this study was to determine the genetic basis of these two traits by analysis of a segregating population of 194 F7 recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between two wheat varieties, grown at six locations in France in 1999. A genetic map of 254 loci was constructed, covering about 75% of the bread wheat genome. QTLs were detected for grain protein-content (GPC), yield and thousand-kernel weight (TKW). 'Stable' QTLs (i.e. detected in at least four of the six locations) were identified for grain protein-content on chromosomes 2A, 3A, 4D and 7D, each explaining about 10% of the phenotypic variation of GPC. For yield, only one important QTL was found on chromosome 7D, explaining up to 15.7% of the phenotypic variation. For TKW, three QTLs were detected on chromosomes 2B, 5B and 7A for all environments. No negative relationships between QTLs for yield and GPC were observed. Factorial Regression on G×E interaction allowed determination of some genetic regions involved in the differential reaction of genotypes to specific climatic factors, such as mean temperature and the number of days with a maximum temperature above 25 °C during grain filling.
