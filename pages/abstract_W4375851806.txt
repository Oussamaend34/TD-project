Fused deposition modelling has become one of the most popular extrusion additive manufacturing technologies over the last decades, since it is easy to handle and user-friendly. However, it still requires special attention regarding its position within different industrial applications; one of the major issues that require additional improvement corresponds to the surface quality. Hence, this work is dedicated to the understanding of the roughness according to three process parameters, namely, printing speed (Spd), layer thickness (Lth), and extrusion temperature (Temp). A Taguchi L27 orthogonal-array was adopted in order to conduct this investigation. Neither post-surface treatments nor any additional surface finishing were applied. Altisurf apparatus was utilized to build 3D images and 2D profiles of the samples’ peaks and depths leading to significant surface sampling regarding the statistical analysis that follows. From a quantitative standpoint, the arithmetic roughness Ra ranged between 7.18 and 13.4 µm, while the best surface quality was reached at the higher scan speed, 4000 mm/min; the smoothest surface was produced at the lowest value of the layer thickness, 0.1 mm; finally, the higher extrusion temperature is the best is the produced surfaces. Moreover, a multiway ANOVA was carried-out leading to select the most significant factors and interactions within the set of inputs. Consequently, the resulting analysis has discriminated the most influenced parameters within the following order, Lth, Spd, and the interactions Temp * Spd, and Lth * Temp. Future works will propose a semi-empirical method including fluid dynamics and thermodynamics involving stochastic parameters to understand roughness variability of FDM produced samples.
