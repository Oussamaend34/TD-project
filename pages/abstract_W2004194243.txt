A comprehensive survey of channel catfish Toll-like receptors (TLRs) was undertaken following a genomic PCR approach based on degenerate primers. Twenty different TLRs were identified in channel catfish. Channel catfish TLR sequences were characterized by phylogenetic analysis based on their conserved Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain and by in-depth analysis of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs of the ligand binding extracellular domain (ECD). The catfish have representatives of all the TLR types defined in vertebrates with the exception of TLR6, TLR10, TLR11, TLR12, TLR13, TLR15, TLR23, and TLR24. Additionally, two new types were discovered: TLR25 and TLR26. TLR25 is also present in cyprinids, cichlids, plecoglossids, and adrianichthyids, suggesting its presence early in fish evolution. To date, TLR26 was found only in channel catfish. Like TLR18–23, TLR25 and TLR26 were not found in any other vertebrate classes and appear to be fish specific. Data mining using the catfish TLR sequences revealed that in addition to ictalurids and cyprinids, TLR4 is also present in salmonids. TLR19 and TLR20 were both found in ictalurids, cyprinids, and salmonids, demonstrating a wider range than previously known. The LRR structure within ECDs appeared generally well conserved. TLR7 demonstrated a very high identity to human TLR7 strongly suggesting that ligand specificity maybe conserved. Finally, expression profiling confirmed that most TLRs are widely expressed in a diversity of tissues and revealed marked differences of expression level.
