The Kettara site (Morocco) is an abandoned pyrrhotite ore mine in a semi-arid environment. The site contains more than 3 million tons of mine waste that have been deposited on the surface without concern for environmental issues. Tailings were stockpiled in a dyke and pond and in piles, over an area of about 16 ha, and have generated acid mine drainage (AMD) for more than 24 years. The mine waste and secondary precipitates from this mine were characterized using geochemical and mineralogical techniques. The Kettara wastes contain 1.6–14.5 wt% sulfur, mainly sulfide minerals (e.g., pyrrhotite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, galena, and sphalerite). The main gangue minerals were goethite, quartz, chlorite-serpentine, talc, muscovite, and albite. Carbonates occur at very low quantities (less than 1 wt%). The most abundant heavy metals were Cu, Zn, Cr, Pb, Co, As, Cd, and Ni. Acid–base accounting static test results showed that all the samples have low values of acid-neutralizing potential (NP) (0–9 kg CaCO3/t). The mine waste has high acid-producing potential (AP) (51–453 kg CaCO3/t). Abundant secondary mineralogy is present, consisting mainly of halotrichite, goethite, jarosite-hydroanion, hydroniumjarosite, starkeyite, gypsum, alunite, copiapite, butterite, and coquimbite. Hardpans, which can prevent water infiltration to fresh tailings beneath and thereby lessen the rate of sulfide reactivity, were observed during sampling of the fine tailings. Mineralogical analysis indicated that the cementitious phase of the hardpan is mainly goethite. The alteration observed in the tailings pond does not extend more than 5–15 cm.
