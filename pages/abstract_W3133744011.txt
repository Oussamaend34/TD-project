Routing and hotspot are considered among the key issues in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Several routing protocols have been proposed; yet they suffer from the lack of fault tolerance, the uneven load balancing and the local optimal solution issues. To fix these issues, we propose in this paper an algorithm named Energy-efficient Cluster-based Routing Protocol using Unequal Clustering and improved Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) techniques (ECRP-UCA). ECRP-UCA divides the network into unequal clusters based on residual energy, distance to the sink, number of neighbor nodes, and a new parameter named number of backward relay nodes in previous round to properly balance the load among Cluster Heads (CHs). We propose also a batch-based clustering method that allows the network to function several rounds without requiring control overhead for its configuration. Additionally, we devise an improved ACO based routing technique for efficient and reliable inter-cluster routing from CHs to the sink. In this algorithm, the heuristic function is formulated considering the energy of next hop sensor node, distance from the current sensor node to the next sensor node and the latter to the destination, and the new parameter Number of Preferred Probable Relay Nodes (NPPRN). By using NPPRN, the ants have the probability to follow other paths, which improves the algorithm’s ability to obtain the optimal global solution and protect the algorithm from converging quickly into the optimal local solution. Moreover, the ant searching direction is improved. The proposed routing protocol is intensively experimented and compared with recent and relevant existing protocols. The simulation results show that the proposed ECRP-UCA outperforms these protocols in terms of various interesting metrics.
