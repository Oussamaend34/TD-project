The inhibitive performance of two imidazole derivatives, namely, 1,4,5-triphenyl-2-(4-metyoxyphenyl)-1H-imidazole (P1) and 1,4,5-triphenyl-2-(3,4,5-trimetyoxyphenyl)-1H-imidazole (P2) on the corrosion of steel in hydrochloric acid 1.0 M, has been studied by weight-loss measurement, polarization method, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and theoretical computational chemistry techniques. The value of inhibition efficiency increases as inhibitor concentration becomes high. The Polarization results indicated that these compounds act as anodic inhibitors in HCl solution. P1 and P2 showed the best protection performances for mild steel in the studied medium. Quantum chemical calculations also showed that imidazole ring has the tendency of interacting with metallic atoms via both forward and backward donations.
