In this paper, a compact micro-sized rhombus-shaped wideband THz antenna is proposed. The radiating patch has been modified by incorporating a rhombus-shaped gold metal-based element within the inscribed square-shaped slot on the surface of the patch. The proposed monopole antenna is designed on a 45-μm-thick polyimide substrate material having a dielectric constant of 4.3. The suggested compact antenna (300 $$\times$$ × 300 µm2) offers high radiation efficiency and wide impedance bandwidth. The designed wideband antenna shows 46.41% impedance bandwidth ranging from 0.445 to 0.714 THz. The simulation results in terms of reflection coefficient, voltage standing wave ratio, gain, directivity, radiation efficiency, radiation pattern, and surface current distribution are analyzed. The designed antenna offers $$-$$ - 10 dB impedance bandwidth of 269 GHz (0.445–0.714 THz), the peak radiation efficiency of 97.3%, peak gain of 5.7 dB, maximum directivity of 6 dB, and good impedance matching characteristics offering minimal VSWR of 1.1 and S11 parameter of $$-$$ - 26.4 dB within the operating band. The suggested THz antenna would be an exemplary choice for future high-speed short-range indoor wireless communication, video rate imaging system, sensing, homeland defense system, biomedical imaging, security scanning, detection of explosive, and material characterization in the THz regime.
