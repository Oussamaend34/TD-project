Abstract Ni-rich cathodes with a radial ordered microstructure have been proved to enhance materials' structural stability. However, the construction process of radial structures has not yet been clearly elaborated. Herein, the formation process of radial structures induced by different doped elements has been systematically investigated. The advanced Electron Back Scatter Diffraction (EBSD) characterization reveals that W-doped materials are more likely to form a low-angle arrangement between crystal planes of the primary particles and exhibit twin growth during sintering than a B-doped cathode. The corresponding High Angle Annular Dark Field-Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (HAADF-STEM) analysis further proves that the twin growth induced by W doping can promote the migration of Li+. Simultaneously, the W-doped sample reduces the (003) plane surface energy and promotes the retention of the crystal plane, which can effectively alleviate the structural degradation caused by Li+ (de)intercalation. At a cut-off voltage of 4.6 V, the W-doped cathode displays a capacity retention rate of 94.1% after 200 cycles at 1C. This work unveils the influence of different element doping on the structure from the perspective of crystal plane orientation within primary particles and points out the importance of the exposure and orientation of the crystal plane of the particles.
