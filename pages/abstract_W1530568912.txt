Background Neural tube defects have a considerable importance becausethey can be prevented by supplementing Folic acid & Vitamin B12 duringpericonceptional period and fortification of staple foods. In Morocco, theMinistry of Health launched a national program for fortification of flour withfolic acid. Our goal should be to evaluate the prevalence of neural tubedefects after fortification. Description This is a retrospective descriptiveat the National Reference Centre for Nutrition and Neonatology of theChildren’s Hospital of Rabat over 4 years. Data were identified from theregistry of congenital malformations held at the perinatology unit. ResultsDuring the 4 years, 674 congenital malformations were identified. The neuraltube defects NTDs account for 11.9%. Their annual prevalence decreasedsignificantly from 21.78 in 2008 to 12.1 per 10,000 total births in 2011. The most common form was anencephaly(60%). Neural tube defects were isolated in 85% of cases and associatedwith other malformations in 15% of cases. 49.4% of infants with neural tubedefects were female and 50.6% were male. Perinatal mortality in newborns withneural tube defects was 63.8% versus 25.2% in malformed newborns without neuraltube defects. Conclusions The neural tube defects seem to be common in ourcontext. Permanent epidemiological surveillance is needed to determine the trueprevalence at the national as well as its temporal trends level.
