Improving organoleptic quality is an important but complex goal for fresh market tomato breeders. A total of 26 traits involved in organoleptic quality variation were evaluated, in order to understand the genetic control of this characteristic. A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population was developed from an intraspecific cross between a cherry tomato line with a good overall aroma intensity and an inbred line with a common taste but with bigger fruits. Physical traits included fruit weight, diameter, color (L,a,b), firmness and elasticity. Chemical traits were dry matter weight, titratable acidity, pH, and the contents of soluble solids, sugars, lycopene, carotene and 12 aroma volatiles. RILs showed a large range of variation for most of the traits and many of them were transgressive. Some correlations between aroma volatiles were in accordance with the metabolic pathway they originated from. A total of 81 significant QTLs were detected for the 26 traits by simple and composite interval mapping. They were mainly distributed in a few regions on chromosomes 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 11 and 12. Major QTLs (R2>30%) were detected for fruit weight, diameter, and color, and for six aroma volatiles. Co-localization of QTLs controlling correlated traits was mainly found on chromosome 2. QTLs for fruit weight and sugar content or dry matter weight were often co-localized. However, a QTL for soluble-solids content and dry matter weight have been detected on chromosome 9 in a region without fruit weight QTLs. QTLs for seven aroma volatiles, lycopene content and fruit color were also co-localized. The QTL localizations were compared with those detected in crosses between Lycopersicon esculentum and wild tomato species.
