In this article we propose a modified compartmental model describing the transmission of COVID-19 in Morocco. It takes account on the asymptomatic people and the strategies involving hospital isolation of the confirmed infected person, quarantine of people contacting them, and home containment of all population to restrict mobility. We establish a relationship between the containment control coefficient $$c_0$$ c 0 and the basic reproduction number $${\mathscr {R}}_0$$ R 0 . Different scenarios are tested with different values of $$c_0$$ c 0 , for which the stability of a Disease Free Equilibrium point is correlated with the condition linking $${\mathscr {R}}_0$$ R 0 and $$c_0$$ c 0 . A worst scenario in which the containment is not respected in the same way during the period of confinement leads to several rebound in the evolution of the pandemic. It is shown that home containment, if it is strictly respected, played a crucial role in controlling the disease spreading.
