The data basis was obtained draw selected traditional herbalists based on the semi-structured questionnaire. Quantitative indices such as use value (UV), family UV (FUV), fidelity level and informant consensus factor (ICF) were intended to evaluate the importance of plant species. A total of 46 plants species belonging to 22 families that were used. Juglandaceae family showed the highest significance (FUV = 0.75). We identified 40 species used for gum disease (gingivitis, periodontal abscess), 15 for dental pain (toothache, tooth sensitivity), 14 for halitosis, 12 for oral ulcers (aphtous, mouth ulcers and herpes), 3 for dental stain (teeth cleaning, sparkling and bleaching) and only 2 for tooth decay.
