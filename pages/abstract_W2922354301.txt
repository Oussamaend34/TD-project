In the present research work, two-dimensional boundary layer flow of Jeffrey fluid over a radially stretching disk in the presence nonlinear Rosseland thermal radiation is investigated. The thermal conductivity and viscosity of Jeffrey fluid are considered variable and assumed to be a function of temperature. The self-similar equations are obtained by employing appropriate transformations. These transformed highly nonlinear equations are solved numerically by a powerful technique generalized differential quadrature method. Chebyshev–Gauss–Lobatto spectral method and midpoint method with Richardson extrapolation (RMM) are also adopted to establish the validity and reliability of the numerical solution. The variations of velocity and temperature profiles with the governing parameters such as Prandtl number, variable viscosity and thermal conductivity parameters, heating parameter, radiation parameter, Deborah number and ratio of relaxation to retardation time are presented and discussed graphically. Reduction in momentum boundary layer thickness and velocity of fluid is observed by increasing variable viscosity ratio parameter $$\delta $$ δ . Velocity of fluid increases, whereas the temperature of fluid decreases with an increase in Deborah number De. The rise in temperature is observed with increasing values of variable thermal conductivity parameter $$\varepsilon $$ ε , ratio of relaxation to retardation time $$\lambda _1 $$ λ 1 and heating parameter $$\theta _{r} $$ θ r .
