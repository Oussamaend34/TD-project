Membranes with ultrahigh permeance and practical selectivity could greatly decrease the cost of difficult industrial gas separations, such as CH4/N2 separation. Advanced membranes made from porous materials, such as metal–organic frameworks, can achieve a good gas separation performance, although they are typically formed on support layers or mixed with polymeric matrices, placing limitations on gas permeance. Here an amorphous glass foam, agfZIF-62, wherein a, g and f denote amorphous, glass and foam, respectively, was synthesized by a polymer-thermal-decomposition-assisted melting strategy, starting from a crystalline zeolitic imidazolate framework, ZIF-62. The thermal decomposition of incorporated low-molecular-weight polyethyleneimine evolves CO2, NH3 and H2O gases, creating a large number and variety of pores. This greatly increases pore interconnectivity but maintains the crystalline ZIF-62 ultramicropores, allowing ultrahigh gas permeance and good selectivity. A self-supported circular agfZIF-62 with a thickness of 200–330 µm and area of 8.55 cm2 was used for membrane separation. The membranes perform well, showing a CH4 permeance of 30,000–50,000 gas permeance units, approximately two orders of magnitude higher than that of other reported membranes, with good CH4/N2 selectivity (4–6). Membranes formed from porous adsorbents can improve the economics of industrially difficult separations but require support materials that reduce gas permeance. Here an amorphous glassy foam membrane without a support is formed from ZIF-62 that shows high selectivity and permeance for CH4/N2 separations.
