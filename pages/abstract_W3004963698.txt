In recent years, 3D model visualization techniques have made enormous progress. This evolution has not only touched the technical side but also the hardware side. It is no longer necessary to have expensive machines to see a world in 3D; a simple computer can do the trick. Historically, research has focused on the development of 3D information and acquisition techniques from scenes and objects. These acquisition methods require expertise and complex calibration procedures whenever the acquisition system was used. All this creates an important demand for flexibility in these methods of acquisition because of these different factors, many techniques have emerged. Many of them only need a camera and a computer to create a 3D world from a scene.
