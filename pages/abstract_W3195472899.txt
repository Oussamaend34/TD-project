Global sustainability movement encourages companies to adopt and implement green supply chain management (GSCM) practices across the organization. Moreover, the integration of green practices into traditional supply chain is still to be a difficult task in manufacturing sector. However, empirical studies regarding the identification of influential factors affecting GSCM adoption among supply chain managers in manufacturing sector are under researched. This study assesses the factors affecting GSCM adoption in Jordan manufacturing firms. A well-structured questionnaire was administered for data collection. A valid 376 responses were collected from different manufacturing firms in Jordan. The data were analyzed, and the proposed model was validated using the structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. Results reveal that four factors, namely, supplier, environmental, customer, and cost factors significantly influence the intention to adopt GSCM among managers. The firm size had significantly moderated the relationship between market/financial and GSCM adoption, internal factor and GSCM adoption. The study will help the policymakers to understand the drivers of GSCM adoption among managers and assist them in implementing GSCM practices according to the size of the firm. This study is first of its kind to analyze the role of firm size as a moderator on the relationship between market/financial, supplier, governmental, environmental, internal, customers, cost factors, and GSCM in the context of Jordon.
