With the increase in energy of the Large Hadron Collider to a centre-of-mass energy of 13 $$\text {TeV}$$ TeV for Run 2, events with dense environments, such as in the cores of high-energy jets, became a focus for new physics searches as well as measurements of the Standard Model. These environments are characterized by charged-particle separations of the order of the tracking detectors sensor granularity. Basic track quantities are compared between 3.2 fb $$^{-1}$$ - 1 of data collected by the ATLAS experiment and simulation of proton–proton collisions producing high-transverse-momentum jets at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 $$\text {TeV}$$ TeV . The impact of charged-particle separations and multiplicities on the track reconstruction performance is discussed. The track reconstruction efficiency in the cores of jets with transverse momenta between 200 and 1600 $$\text {GeV}$$ GeV is quantified using a novel, data-driven, method. The method uses the energy loss, $${\text { d}}{} \textit{E}/d\textit{x}$$ d E / d x , to identify pixel clusters originating from two charged particles. Of the charged particles creating these clusters, the measured fraction that fail to be reconstructed is $$0.061 \pm 0.006\ {\text {(stat.)}} \pm 0.014\ {\text {(syst.)}}$$ 0.061 ± 0.006 (stat.) ± 0.014 (syst.) and $$0.093 \pm 0.017\ {\text {(stat.)}}\pm 0.021\ {\text {(syst.)}}$$ 0.093 ± 0.017 (stat.) ± 0.021 (syst.) for jet transverse momenta of 200–400 $$\text {GeV}$$ GeV and 1400–1600 $$\text {GeV}$$ GeV , respectively.
