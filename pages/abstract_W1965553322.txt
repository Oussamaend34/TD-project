In many wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) growing areas, pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) may cause important damage, and in particular, it has deleterious effects on bread-making quality. The relationship between PHS and grain color is well known and could be due either to the pleiotropic effect of genes controlling red-testa pigmentation (R) or to linkage between these genes and other genes affecting PHS. In the present work, we have studied a population of 194 recombinant inbred lines from the cross between two cultivars, ’Renan’ and ’Récital’, in order to detect QTLs for both PHS resistance and grain color. The variety ’Renan’ has red kernels and is resistant to PHS, while ’Récital’ has white grain and is highly susceptible to PHS. A molecular-marker linkage map of this cross was constructed using SSRs, RFLPs and AFLPs. The population was evaluated over 2 years at Clermont-Ferrand (France). PHS was evaluated on mature spikes under controlled conditions and red-grain color was measured using a chromameter. Over the 2 years, we detected four QTLs for PHS, all of them being co-localized with QTLs for grain color. Three of them were located on the long arm of chromosomes 3 A, 3B and 3D, close to the loci where the genes R and taVp1 were previously mapped. For these three QTLs, the resistance to PHS is due to the allele of the variety ’Renan’. Another co-located QTL for PHS and grain color was detected on the short arm of chromosome 5 A. The resistance for PHS for this QTL is due to the allele of ’Récital’.
