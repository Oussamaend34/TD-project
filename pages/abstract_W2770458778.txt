Arabic is an old Semitic language, the standardization of its lexicon and grammar are deeply rooted and well established a long time ago in history. Arabic is a morphologically rich language characterized by the phenomenon of derivation and inflection. It is an international language with over 500 million native speakers around 29 countries. In the last 15 years, Arabic has achieved the highest growth of the ten top online languages. Consequently, the volume of stored electronic information increases rapidly. Despite this proud heritage, lexical richness, and online user growth, Arabic is relatively an under-resourced language compared to other languages with less or similar population size (e.g., French and German). The boundaries of this chapter cover the major progress that has been made in Arabic linguistic resources, primarily corpora compilation and the challenges that researchers face in the development of such process. It is hoped that this overall view of the Arabic corpus linguistics would guide current and future research directions.
