A smart grid is an intelligent electricity grid that optimizes the generation, distribution and consumption of electricity through the introduction of Information and Communication Technologies on the electricity grid. In essence, smart grids bring profound changes in the information systems that drive them: new information flows coming from the electricity grid, new players such as decentralized producers of renewable energies, new uses such as electric vehicles and connected houses and new communicating equipments such as smart meters, sensors and remote control points. All this will cause a deluge of data that the energy companies will have to face. Big Data technologies offers suitable solutions for utilities, but the decision about which Big Data technology to use is critical. In this paper, we provide an overview of data management for smart grids, summarise the added value of Big Data technologies for this kind of data, and discuss the technical requirements, the tools and the main steps to implement Big Data solutions in the smart grid context.
