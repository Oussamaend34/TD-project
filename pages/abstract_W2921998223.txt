This paper presents measurements of $$W^{\pm }Z$$ W ± Z production cross sections in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 $$\text {TeV}$$ TeV . The data were collected in 2015 and 2016 by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, and correspond to an integrated luminosity of $$36.1~\hbox {fb}^{-1}$$ 36.1 fb - 1 . The $$W^{\pm }Z$$ W ± Z candidate events are reconstructed using leptonic decay modes of the gauge bosons into electrons and muons. The measured inclusive cross section in the detector fiducial region for a single leptonic decay mode is $$\sigma _{W^\pm Z \rightarrow \ell ^{'} \nu \ell \ell }^{\text {fid.}} = 63.7 \, \pm ~1.0~\text {(stat.)} \, \pm ~2.3~\text {(syst.)} \, \pm ~1.4~\text {(lumi.)}$$ σ W ± Z → ℓ ′ ν ℓ ℓ fid. = 63.7 ± 1.0 (stat.) ± 2.3 (syst.) ± 1.4 (lumi.) fb, reproduced by the next-to-next-to-leading-order Standard Model prediction of $$61.5^{+1.4}_{-1.3}$$ 61 . 5 - 1.3 + 1.4 fb. Cross sections for $$W^+Z$$ W + Z and $$W^-Z$$ W - Z production and their ratio are presented as well as differential cross sections for several kinematic observables. An analysis of angular distributions of leptons from decays of W and Z bosons is performed for the first time in pair-produced events in hadronic collisions, and integrated helicity fractions in the detector fiducial region are measured for the W and Z bosons separately. Of particular interest, the longitudinal helicity fraction of pair-produced vector bosons is also measured.
