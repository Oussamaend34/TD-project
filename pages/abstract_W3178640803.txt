In this paper, we present a theoretical study of the propagation properties for Generalized Humbert-Gaussian beams (GHGBs) passing through a turbulent atmosphere. The axial intensity distribution of beams propagating through atmospheric turbulence is evaluated analytically based on the Huygens-Fresnel diffraction integral and the Rytov theory. The impact of the incident beam parameters and the turbulent strength on the output axial intensity is investigated through numerical illustrations. The results show that the propagation of GHGBs is faster when the atmosphere is very turbulent for small wavelength and small beam waist.
