With the evolution and the development of data-processing tools and their pervasive scopes of applications, the need for data protection today has become a crucial necessity in order to reduce the number of incidents caused by non-authorized data accesses and to prevent malicious usage. With the purpose of maintaining a significantly high level of security, cryptography englobes the entirety of methods as well as a couple of techniques and tools aimed to assure data confidentiality. Indeed, this work’s main focus is a new approach based on a four-square encryption accompanied by a zigzag transformation. This approach allows us to provide the appropriate settings for the four-square technique and the new conception of a transformation that manages future plans. These last are immune to brute attacks and statistic attacks. Considering all of that, this exhaustive study will emphasize the reliability of this approach.
