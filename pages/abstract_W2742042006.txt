Abstract Influenza D virus has been identified in America, Europe, and Asia. We detected influenza D virus antibodies in cattle and small ruminants from North (Morocco) and West (Togo and Benin) Africa. Dromedary camels in Kenya harbored influenza C or D virus antibodies, indicating a potential new host for these viruses. Figure 1 Figure 1. Locations where IDV or IDV antibodies had been detected as of April 2017. Species from which virus or antibodies were detected are indicated. IDV, influenza D virus. Influenza D virus (IDV) was recently discovered in the United States in a pig with influenza-like symptoms (1). So far, IDV or IDV antibodies have been detected in the United States, Mexico, France, Italy, China, and Japan, in healthy or sick cattle and pigs that had respiratory signs (1–6) (Figure 1). The pathogenesis and transmission of this virus are not fully understood, but recent experimental infection of calves showed that IDV can cause moderate respiratory disease (7) and that the virus is related to the bovine respiratory disease complex (2), which is a disease with very large economic costs and public health impact. The ability of IDV to replicate in ferrets, the animal model of choice for studying influenza virus in humans (1), and in guinea pigs (8) indicates that IDV might have a wider host range than currently expected and that humans may be susceptible to infection. In addition to swine and cattle, anti-IDV antibodies have been detected in goats and sheep (9). We conducted a study to assess the putative IDV circulation in Africa.
