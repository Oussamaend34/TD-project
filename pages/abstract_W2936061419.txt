Abstract The effects of the magnesium doping of binary glass (Si–Ca) on particle texture, on the biomineralization process in simulated body fluid (SBF) as well as on drug loading and release were examined. For this purpose, magnesium-doped binary bioglass nanoparticles (85SiO2–(15 − x)CaO–xMgO, with x = 1, 3, 5 and 10 mol%) were prepared by a base catalysed sol–gel method. N2 adsorption isotherm analysis showed an enhancement in specific surface area as the Mg molar fraction increased. In addition, the FTIR spectra of the samples after soaking in SBF for various periods of time confirmed the presence of new chemical bonds related to the apatite phase, as was also confirmed by SEM observations. XRD patterns of the samples after soaking revealed that the crystallization to form a more stable apatite-like phase was hindered with increasing magnesium content in the glass composition. Furthermore, it was proved that the kinetics of drug release improved with increasing magnesium content. The porosity and the specific surface area were found to be responsible for this improvement.
