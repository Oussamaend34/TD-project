We theoretically investigate continuous variable entanglement and macroscopic quantum coherence in the hybrid L–G rotational cavity optomechanical system containing two YIG spheres. In this system, a single L–G cavity mode and both magnon modes (which are due to the collective excitation of spins in two YIG spheres) are coupled through the magnetic dipole interaction whereas the L–G cavity mode can also exchange orbital angular momentum (OAM) with the rotating mirror (RM). We study in detail the effects of various physical parameters like cavity and both magnon detunings, environment temperature, optorotational and magnon coupling strengths on the bipartite entanglement and the macroscopic quantum coherence as well. We also explore parameter regimes to achieve maximum values for both of these quantum correlations. We also observed that the parameters regime for achieving maximum bipartite entanglement is completely different from macroscopic quantum coherence. So, our present study shall provide a method to control various nonclassical quantum correlations of macroscopic objects in the hybrid L–G rotational cavity optomechanical system and have potential applications in quantum sensing, quantum meteorology, and quantum information science.
