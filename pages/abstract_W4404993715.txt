This study investigated the potentially toxic elements (PTEs) contamination of Betoya Bay surface sediments to assess the degree of pollution and identify the source of these contaminants. Average PTE levels as mg/kg in Betoya Bay are ranked in descending order as Zn (22.68) > Cr (8.64) > Pb (7.24) > Ni (6.82) > As (6.62) > Cu (5.78) > Co (2.45) > Cd (0.20). The sampling sites show an increase in PTEs at station 5, probably due to runoff from the wadi, and at the first station, where fishing activity is particularly intense. At all stations throughout the year, PTE levels were unpolluted as evaluated by the geoaccumulation index (Igeo) and the pollution load index (PLI). Almost all PTEs showed a “low contamination factor” according to the contamination factor index (CF). As assessed by the contamination degree (CD), all PTE levels at all stations and seasons were “low contamination degree”. The ecological risk indices (Eir and RI) indicated low to moderate ecological risk. In line with sediment quality requirements, the M-ERM-Q calculation suggests there is only a 9% chance that this particular combination of metals poses a threat. The non-carcinogenic health risk assessment showed that beach sand in the study area is entirely safe, presenting no additional health risk to children or adults. However, the carcinogenic risk showed a low to moderate carcinogenic risk for adults and a moderate to high carcinogenic risk for children. In addition, statistical analysis revealed that all PTEs are likely to have common sources, which may be related to the geology of the area.
