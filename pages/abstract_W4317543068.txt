AbstractThis work presents a numerical analysis of a lead-free Cs2SnI6-based perovskite solar cell employing ZnO as the electron transport layer (ETL), and NiO as the hole transport layer (HTL). These two materials gave a significant performance in front of other transport charge materials. After selecting the charge transport layers (ZnO, and NiO), we have optimized their thicknesses as well as their doping concentrations. We have also analyzed the impact of the absorber thickness, its defect density (Nt), the defect density at the interfaces (NiO/Cs2SnI6 and Cs2SnI6/ZnO), and the influence of temperature on the output parameters. Finally we have obtained a solar device based on Cs2SnI6 with a fully inorganic ITO/CuI/Cs2SnI6/ ZnO/AZO/Ag structure, with an efficiency of 14.65% at room temperature and 16.77% at 400 K. The results show that Cs2SnI6 can play an important role as an absorbing perovskite in the development of solar cell technology.
