Photovoltaic panels are made from photovoltaic cells, generally based on silicon, their semiconductor properties allow the panels to capture solar radiation and transform it into electrical voltage by the photovoltaic effect. The design of an efficient photovoltaic system requires the consideration of several power losses that have a direct influence on the overall efficiency of the system. The aim of this chapter is to identify the main factors causing power losses in a photovoltaic installation including temperature rise, the effect of shading, the effect of series resistance, and the effect of shunt resistance as well as losses in the electrical cables and to simulate these losses for each installation components. The results of this study showed that about 40% of the output of a photovoltaic installation is lost, with losses ranging from 3 to 14% for each element. These results can be used by manufacturers to optimize the choice of materials for photovoltaic cells as well as the components constituting the photovoltaic installation in order to reduce these power losses. Therefore, an intelligent cooling system guided by an Arduino board was proposed to reduce the losses caused by the temperature increase.
