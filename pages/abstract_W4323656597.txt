In this study, Oregano (Origanum vulgare) leaf essential oil was studied as an environmental-friendly anticorrosion agent for carbon steel in aggressive hydrochloric acid. The corrosion inhibition of O. vulgare was characterized by surface morphology, electrochemical, weight loss, theoretical and computational methods. It was found that the highest inhibition performance of O. vulgare was 85.64% at 2 g/l in 1 M HCl. The results of Langmuir isotherm and adsorption thermodynamics investigation demonstrated that the O. vulgare inhibitor adsorbed on the metal surface by the formation of rigid covalent bonds. The adsorption and inhibition centers of the selected inhibitor were studied by the computational methods, resulting in that the hydroxyl functional groups and benzoyl rings are mainly responsible for the high inhibition efficiency.
