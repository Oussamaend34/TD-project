In this article, we construct new explicit solutions for a time-fractional nonlinear Calogero-Bogoyavlenskii-Schiff equation in $(2+1)$ ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions with conformable derivative with the help of the $\tan (\phi(\xi)/2)$ tan ( ϕ ( ξ ) / 2 ) -expansion method. The obtained solutions are expressed by different kinds of functions, such as exponential, hyperbolic and trigonometric ones. The solutions might be very useful in physics and engineering sciences.
