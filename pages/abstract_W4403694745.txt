This study investigates noise reduction using a periodic arrangement of dual Helmholtz resonators and explores the introduction of defects within this periodic structure. The transfer matrix method was employed to carry out theoretical research. The computations of the interface response function approach results are verified, and consistent outcomes are demonstrated. The simulation results highlight the distinctive dual resonance frequencies of dual Helmholtz resonators. By differentiating dual Helmholtz resonators from traditional Helmholtz resonators, prospective applications for low-frequency noise reduction are envisioned. In this contribution, introducing defects in the middle of perfect dual Helmholtz resonators adds more value to the acoustic filter. In particular, the first neck and cavity of the defective dual Helmholtz resonator. This study shows that introducing a 2D-defect into identical dual Helmholtz resonators can improve the transmission of defect modes by taking advantage of the advantageous interaction of the resonant modes. In such arrangements, the entire structure functioned as a potent selective filter.
