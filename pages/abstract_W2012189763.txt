Seven banana cultivars (Musa acuminata, AAA group) were inoculated with two species of vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi (Glomus mosseae and Glomus macrocarpum) in a greenhouse experiment. Inoculated plants had generally greater shoot dry weight and shoot phosphorus concentrations compared to the noninoculated plants. A great variation in dependency on mycorrhizal colonization was observed among the banana cultivars. Cv. Williams showed the highest relative mycorrhizal dependency (RMD) and cv. Poyo the lowest. For all the cultivars studied, inoculation with G. macrocarpum resulted in the highest RMD values. Both root dry weight and root hair length or density of the noninoculated plants were inverserly correlated with the RMD values of cultivars.
