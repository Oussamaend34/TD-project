In this paper, we applied some computational tools, namely the modified extended tanh method via a Riccati equation, the general Exp $$_{a}$$ a -function method and the bifurcation methods to study a nonlinear (2+1)-dimensional Bogoyavlenskii coupled system in thin-film ferroelectric medium to construct exact traveling wave solutions. By applying a classical wave transformation we obtained an ordinary differential equations. As a result, some new traveling wave solutions are obtained including hyperbolic, trigonometric, exponential functions and rational forms. If the parameters take specific values, then the periodic wave, solitary waves, kink and anti-kink wave solutions are derived from the traveling waves. Also, we draw 2D and 3D graphics of exact solutions for the special cases of these nonlinear equations by the help of programming language Maple.
