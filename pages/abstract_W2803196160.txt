In the present study, we are interested in one of the most valuable medical plants, Aloe vera. It belongs to the family of xanthorroeaceae. This succulent plant possesses exceptional therapeutic virtues. For reasons principally related to its biological activities, Aloe vera has been traditionally used as a remedy for multiple diseases all over the globe. This study aims at characterization of tannins extract of Aloe vera (TAV) by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/MS), phytochemical screening, morphological and histological identification of the species and extraction (tannins extract) from its green rind. The antioxidant activity of the tannins extract was tested using the 1.1-diphenyl-2-Picrylhydrazyl-Hydrate (DPPH) method. The results of the main constituents found were Palmitic acid (11.91%), E-Phytol (14.40%), Linolenic acid (16.59%), Diisooctylphtalate (11.84%). The tannins extract was also fractionated over a silica gel dry column. Three main fractions were isolated. The first fraction contains 25.99% of Palmitic acid, the second comprised Dibutyl phthalate (30.93%), and the third fraction showed an amount of 54.13% Diisooctylphtalate. The phytochemical screening showed the alkaloid, tannins, flavonoids, sterols, triterpenes, mucilages, oses, holosides and it reducing compounds metabolites, As for the coumarines and saponins, they were absent. The tannins extract showed an antiradical activity with percentage inhibition about 74.17% at 6 mg/ml.
