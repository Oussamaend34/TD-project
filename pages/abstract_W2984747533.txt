Pinus pinaster bark, an abundant by-product from the timber industry, has been studied as a potential low-cost adsorbent for the removal of Congo red (CR) dye from wastewaters. Surface morphological and physico-chemical characteristics of pine bark were analysed using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), determination of the point of zero charge (pHPZC) and elemental analysis. Assays were performed to determine the wavelength for the maximum absorbance and the stability with time of CR solutions depending on concentration and/or pH, which resulted to be a very significant parameter. Adsorption studies were conducted on batch mode to study the effect of contact time (till 7 days), pH (2–9), adsorbent dosage (1–10 g L−1) and temperature (25–60 °C). The bark adsorption capacity at equilibrium varied between 0.3 and 1.6 mg g−1 and the equilibrium adsorption percentage between 23.4 and 100% depending on adsorbent dosage, temperature and pH at an initial CR concentration of 5 mg L−1. Kinetic data for the removal of CR by pine bark were best fitted by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The equilibrium data fitted well with the Freundlich model. Thermodynamic analysis indicated that the adsorption process is exothermic and spontaneous.
