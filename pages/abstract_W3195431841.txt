The coronavirus pandemic, which appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, rapidly spread all over the world in only a few weeks. Faster testing techniques requiring less resources are key in managing the pandemic, either to enable larger scale testing or even just provide developing countries with limited resources, particularly in Africa, means to perform tests to manage the crisis. Here, we report an unprecedented, rapid, reagent-free and easy-to-use screening spectroscopic method for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 on RNA extracts. This method, validated on clinical samples collected from 280 patients with quantitative predictive scores on both positive and negative samples, is based on a multivariate analysis of FTIR spectra of RNA extracts. This technique, in agreement with RT-PCR, achieves 97.8% accuracy, 97% sensitivity and 98.3% specificity while reducing the testing time post RNA extraction from hours to minutes. Furthermore, this technique can be used in several laboratories with limited resources.
