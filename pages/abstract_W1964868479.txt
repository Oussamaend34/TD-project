A grapevine (mainly Vitis vinifera L., 2n = 38) composite genetic map was constructed with CarthaGene using segregation data from five full-sib populations of 46, 95, 114, 139 and 153 individuals, to determine the relative position of a large set of molecular markers. This consensus map comprised 515 loci (502 SSRs and 13 other type PCR-based markers), amplified using 439 primer pairs (426 SSRs and 13 others) with 50.1% common markers shared by at least two crosses. Out of all loci, 257, 85, 74, 69 and 30 were mapped in 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 individual mapping populations, respectively. Marker order was generally well conserved between maps of individual populations, with only a few significant differences in the recombination rate of marker pairs between two or more populations. The total length of the integrated map was 1,647 cM Kosambi covering 19 linkage groups, with a mean distance between neighbour loci of 3.3 cM. A framework-integrated map was also built, with marker order supported by a LOD of 2.0. It included 257 loci spanning 1,485 cM Kosambi with a mean inter-locus distance of 6.2 cM over 19 linkage groups. These integrated maps are the most comprehensive SSR-based maps available so far in grapevine and will serve either for choosing markers evenly scattered over the whole genome or for selecting markers that cover particular regions of interest. The framework map is also a useful starting point for the integration of the V. vinifera physical and genetic maps.
