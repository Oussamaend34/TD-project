In the present paper, we have performed a theoretical investigation of the influence of the Kratzer potential on the nonlinear optical rectification coefficient and the second harmonic generation of a multilayered spherical quantum dot. The nonlinear optical rectification coefficient was investigated for various transitions between the ground state and several excited states. The computations were carried out using the finite element technique and the effective mass approximation. We have found that potential parameters (the depth of the potential and the minimum point) affect the second harmonic generation and the nonlinear optical rectification coefficient.
