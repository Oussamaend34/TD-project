Our work is to compare the rheological behaviors of the three synthesized multifunctional epoxy resins: triglycidyl ether tribisphenol A of ethylene (TGEEBA), hexaglycidyl ethylene of trimethylene dianiline (HGEMDA) and nanoglycidyl trihydrazine 4.4.4-tripropoxy tribisphenol A of ethylene (NGHPBAE). As a first step, we crosslinked and formulated these three composite by means of methylene dianiline in the presence of different percentages (5%, 10% and 15%) of the natural phosphate as filler. In the second stage, we made a comparative study of the rheological properties of these three synthesized epoxy matrices. The latter plays a major role in the phenomenon of their flow and their implementation. Then, we carried out a comparative study of the thermodynamic parameters, namely: glass transition temperature, activation energy, enthalpy variation and entropy variation.
