Abstract With the current movement of "glocalization" imposed by openness to the global sphere and the necessary anchoring to the local, the productive systems - from here and elsewhere - can no longer be non-territorial or autarkic. As much openness opens up the prospect of competitiveness, as much the local territory ensures a kind of "rescue net" and refuge in the event of global crises that have become frequent. Whether it is the social movement paradigm or the local production system canvas "glocalization" is justified by the wealth potential that territories of any nation seeking its competitiveness on the international scene conceal. To identify, grasp, understand and value such a territorial resource, the diagnosis of the existing is necessary. Socio-spatial disparities are at the heart of the problems of regional development confronted with the double malaise of poverty and environmental degradation. With the certainty that wealth is created within companies and that they are the key players in territorial development, the analysis of the spatial anatomy of productive systems provides information on the symbiosis between the productive and the spatial. Without claiming to reproduce the evolution of productive systems and their spatial expressions in its completeness, this paper proposes to explore the major territorialized forms that the productive system in Morocco has taken from independence to our day. It's all about finding to characterize the specificities of Morocco in this matter by launching a sort of a provisional assessment. The main question here is to approach a kind of model in gestation that Morocco can create for the rest of Africa at this spatial / productive level.
