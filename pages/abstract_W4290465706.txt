Climate problems and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are driving researchers to find less polluting ways of generating electricity. One of the commonly used renewable energy sources is the sun, which is the basis for the use of photovoltaic (PV) energy to produce electricity through PV panels. In this context, based on the annual electricity consumption of the annex of the Faculty of Science in Rabat, we dimensioned the PV field needed to compensate this consumption as well as the global cost of this insultation, then using PVSYST we evaluated the annual electricity production and the percentage of power losses. The economic study determined the price per kWh and the payback period, and the environmental study showed that the use of this installation will save 6142 tCO2.
