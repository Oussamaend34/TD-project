Ovarian folliculogenesis in mammals from the constitution of primordial follicles up to ovulation is a reasonably well understood mechanism. Nevertheless, underlying mechanisms that determine the number of ovulating follicles were enigmatic until the identification of the fecundity genes affecting ovulation rate in sheep, bone morphogenetic protein-15 (BMP-15), growth and differentiation factor-9 (GDF-9) and BMP receptor-1B (BMPR-1B). In this review, we focus on the use of these sheep genetic models for understanding the role of the BMP system as an intra-ovarian regulator of follicular growth and maturation, and finally, ovulation rate.
