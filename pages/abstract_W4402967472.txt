Brain tumor is a type of disease caused by uncontrolled cell proliferation in the brain leading to serious health issues such as memory loss and motor impairment. Therefore, early diagnosis of brain tumors plays a crucial role to extend the survival of patients. However, given the busy nature of the work of radiologists and aiming to reduce the likelihood of false diagnoses, advancing technologies including computer-aided diagnosis and artificial intelligence have shown an important role in assisting radiologists. In recent years, a number of deep learning-based methods have been applied for brain tumor detection and classification using MRI images and achieved promising results. The main objective of this paper is to present a detailed review of the previous researches in this field. In addition, This work summarizes the existing limitations and significant highlights. The study systematically reviews 60 articles researches published between 2020 and January 2024, extensively covering methods such as transfer learning, autoencoders, transformers, and attention mechanisms. The key findings formulated in this paper provide an analytic comparison and future directions. The review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of automatic techniques that may be useful for professionals and academic communities working on brain tumor classification and detection.
