Managing the new product development (NPD) is a challenging mission, and most researches would argue that design is fundamentally linked to intentional action and it cannot emerge out of complexity. In fact, its complexity is generated by a large number of entities and actors which cooperate simultaneously with an unpredictable way to understand what customers want and then design product with diverse objectives in mind. A slight change in one activity may cause tremors everywhere. Within a dynamic environment and in order to meet concurrently these challenges, several researchers have implemented design for X (DFX) techniques. Regarding the availability of numerous DFX, the decision as to which one to apply remains absent. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to present a comprehensive overview of the most prominent DFX techniques with respect to sustainability dimension as well as the cost ownership and product differentiation strategies. In addition to that, complex product necessitates the consideration of integrated DFX to optimize product life cycle from a more holistic perspective. In this respect, the paper addresses a systematic review from 1980 to 2018 by investigating and discussing the past and current research of each DFX techniques as well as for integrated ones. The key problems and issues that future DFX research should address have been identified and discussed in this paper.
