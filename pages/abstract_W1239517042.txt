We made an update of the intervarietal molecular marker linkage map of the wheat genome developed using a doubled-haploid (DH) population derived from the cross between the cultivars 'Courtot' and 'Chinese Spring'. This map was constructed using 187 DH lines and 659 markers. The genome was well covered (more than 95%) except for chromosomes from homoeologous group 4 and chromosomes 5D and 7D, which had gaps slightly larger than 50 cM. A core-map based on a set of 200 anchor loci (one marker each 18.4 cM) was developed. The total length of this map was 3,685 cM which is similar to the size of the international reference map of the ITMI population (3,551 cM). Map coverage was identical for the three genomes (A, B and D) and for the number of anchor loci, as well as for the size of the map. Using this map, QTLs for several agronomic traits were detected on phenotypic data from the population grown in Clermont-Ferrand (France) under natural field conditions over 6 years, and in Norwich (UK) in controlled conditions and under natural field conditions in 1 year. Almost all of the 21 chromosomes were involved in at least one trait. However, several regions seemed to contain gene clusters either for grain traits (and thus bread-making quality) or plant development traits.
