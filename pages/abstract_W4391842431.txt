Groundwater serves as a primary water source for various purposes. Therefore, aquifer pollution poses a critical threat to human health and the environment. Identifying the aquifer’s highly vulnerable areas to pollution is necessary to implement appropriate remedial measures, thus ensuring groundwater sustainability. This paper aims to enhance groundwater vulnerability assessment (GWVA) to manage aquifer quality effectively. The study focuses on the El Orjane Aquifer in the Moulouya basin, Morocco, which is facing significant degradation due to olive mill wastewater. Groundwater vulnerability maps (GVMs) were generated using the DRASTIC, Pesticide DRASTIC, SINTACS, and SI methods. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed improvements, 24 piezometers were installed to measure nitrate concentrations, a common indicator of groundwater contamination. This study aimed to enhance GWVA by incorporating new layers, such as land use, and adjusting parameter rates based on a comprehensive sensitivity analysis. The results demonstrate a significant increase in Pearson correlation values (PCV) between the produced GVMs and measured nitrate concentrations. For instance, the PCV for the DRASTIC method improved from 0.42 to 0.75 after adding the land use layer and adjusting parameter rates using the Wilcoxon method. These findings offer valuable insights for accurately assessing groundwater vulnerability in areas with similar hazards and hydrological conditions, particularly in semi-arid and arid regions. They contribute to improving groundwater and environmental management practices, ensuring the long-term sustainability of aquifers.
