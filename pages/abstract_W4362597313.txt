Objective This study investigated the impacts of SIRT1 activation on rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-related angiogenesis. Methods HUVECs were cultured by different human serum. Intracellular metabolites were quantified by UPLC-MS. Next, HUVECs and rat vascular epithelial cells under different inflammatory conditions were treated by a SIRT1 agonist resveratrol (RSV). Cytokines and biochemical indicators were detected by corresponding kits. Protein and mRNA expression levels were assessed by immunoblotting and PCR methods, respectively. Angiogenesis capabilities were evaluated by migration, wound-healing and tube-formation experiments. To down-regulate certain signals, gene-specific siRNA were applied. Results Metabolomics study revealed the accelerated glycolysis in RA serum-treated HUVECs. It led to ATP accumulation, but did not affect GTP levels. RSV inhibited pro-angiogenesis cytokines production and glycolysis in both the cells, and impaired the angiogenesis potentials. These effects were mimicked by an energy metabolism interrupter bikini in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-primed HUVECs, largely independent of HIF-1α. Both RSV and bikinin can inhibit the activation of the GTP-dependent pathway Rho/ROCK and reduce VEGF production. Abrogation of RhoA signaling reinforced HIF-1α silencing-brought changes in LPS-stimulated HUVECs, and overshadowed the anti-angiogenesis potentials of RSV. Conclusion Glycolysis provides additional energy to sustain Rho/ROCK activation in RA subjects, which promotes VEGF-driven angiogenesis and can be inhibited by SIRT1 activation.
