AbstractDespite the role of excitatory transmission to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in the actions of most drugs of abuse, the presence and functions of cannabinoid receptors (CB1) on the glutamatergic cortical afferents to the NAc have never been explored. Here, immunohistochemistry has been used to show the localization of CB1 receptors on axonal terminals making contacts with the NAc GABAergic neurons. Electrophysiological techniques in the NAc slice preparation revealed that cannabimimetics [WIN 55,212,2 (WIN-2) and CP55940] strongly inhibit stimulus-evoked glutamate-mediated transmission. The inhibitory actions of WIN-2 were dose-dependent (EC50 of 293 ± 13 nm) and reversed by the selective CB1 antagonist SR 141716A. In agreement with a presynaptic localization of CB1 receptors, WIN-2 increased paired-pulse facilitation, decreased miniature EPSC (mEPSC) frequency, and had no effect on the mEPSCs amplitude. Perfusion with the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin enhanced glutamatergic transmission but did not alter presynaptic CB1 actions, suggesting that cannabinoids inhibit glutamate release independently from the cAMP–PKA cascade. CB1 did not reduce evoked transmitter release by inhibiting presynaptic voltage-dependent Ca2+ currents through N-, L-, or P/Q-type Ca2+ channels, because CB1 inhibition persisted in the presence of ω-Conotoxin-GVIA, nimodipine, or ω-Agatoxin-IVA. The K+ channel blockers 4-aminopyridine (100 μm) and BaCl2 (300 μm) each reduced by 40–50% the inhibitory actions of WIN-2, and their effects were additive. These data suggest that CB1 receptors are located on the cortical afferents to the nucleus and can reduce glutamate synaptic transmission within the NAc by modulating K+ channels activity.nucleus accumbenscannabinoidglutamateCB1 receptorspresynaptic inhibitionK+ channelsmiceDerivatives of Cannabis sativa (L.), such as marijuana and hashish, have been used for centuries for therapeutic and recreational purposes. The psychopharmacologically active component of C. sativa, (−)-trans-delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol, as well as cannabimimetics and endocannabinoids, mediate their actions in the CNS through specific interactions with a Gi/Go-protein-coupled receptor [cannabinoid receptor (CB1)] (Mechoulam et al., 1996). The CB1 receptor is widely expressed in the brain and has been shown to inhibit adenylate cyclase (AC), activate mitogen-activated protein kinases, reduce Ca2+ currents, and modulate several K+ conductances (Mackie and Hille, 1992;Mackie et al., 1993, 1995; Bouaboula et al., 1995; Twitchell et al., 1997; Schweitzer, 2000). Activation of CB1 receptors inhibits synaptic transmission in the hippocampus (Sullivan, 1999; Hoffman and Lupica, 2000), substantia nigra pars compacta (Chan and Yung, 1998), the cerebellum (Levenes et al., 1998), and the prefrontal cortex (Auclair et al., 2000).The mesolimbic–mesocortical dopaminergic system and particularly the nucleus accumbens (NAc) are essential to the reinforcing properties of addictive drugs (Hyman, 1996; Koob, 1996). Drugs of abuse, such as psychostimulants, opiates, nicotine, alcohol, and cannabinoids, alter dopamine levels in the NAc (Kalivas and Duffy, 1990; Self and Nestler, 1995; Tanda et al., 1997; Pontieri et al., 1998). Because of intrinsic and network properties, the projection cells of the NAc, the GABAergic medium-spiny neurons, depend on glutamatergic excitatory afferents to generate action potentials (Pennartz et al., 1994). Glutamatergic transmission in the NAc participates in the effects of opiates and psychostimulants (Pulvirenti et al., 1989, 1991, 1992; Pap and Bradberry, 1995; Cornish and Kalivas, 2000) and is altered by chronic drug treatment (Nie et al., 1994; Pierce et al., 1996a,b; Manzoni et al., 1998). Although cannabis derivatives are the most common illicit drugs, little is known of their actions in the mesolimbic regions and the NAc. In particular, the potential effects of cannabinoids on the excitatory afferents to the NAc have never been explored.The specific purpose of this study was to identify the localization and functions of CB1 receptors at the glutamatergic cortical–NAc synapses. Using immunohistochemical techniques, we identified CB1 receptors on afferents making synaptic-like contacts with GABAergic neurons (presumably medium spiny neurons) of the NAc. It was found that CB1 receptors inhibit glutamatergic excitatory synaptic transmission through the modulation of presynaptic K+conductances.
