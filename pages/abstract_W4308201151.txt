Interests play an essential role in the process of learning, thereby enriching learners ‘interests will yield to an enhanced experience in MOOCs. Learners interact freely and spontaneously on social media through different forms of user-generated content which contain hidden information that reveals their real interests and preferences. In this paper, we aim to identify and extract the topical interest from the text content shared by learners on social media to enrich their course preferences in MOOCs. We apply NLP pipeline and topic modeling techniques to the textual feature using three well-known topic models: Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Latent Semantic Analysis, and BERTopic. The results of our experimentation have shown that BERTopic performed better on the scrapped dataset.
