Background Our goal was to investigate the prevalence of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation in Middle East and African countries and to compare its prevalence with that shown in other populations. Methods We used PubMed and the Cochrane Library databases to conduct a literature search using the terms “[EGFR] AND [mutation] AND [Non Small Cell Lung Cancer] AND [Middle East OR Africa].” We assessed studies published in English and French from 2004 until 2016. Results Ten relevant studies were included in this systematic review. Overall, 1215 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were included in this analysis. The overall ratio of male to female patients was 2.15. Of total patients included, 41.1% had never smoked and 85.8% had been diagnosed with adenocarcinoma. In 8 of the 10 studies, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses were conducted to identify EGFR mutations. In total, 257 patients had an EGFR mutation, corresponding to a prevalence of 21.2%. The most frequent abnormality detected in all of the studies was in exon 19. In addition, all studies concluded the presence of a correlation between EGFR mutation status and female sex, non-smoking status, and adenocarcinoma subtype. Conclusions The EGFR mutation frequency in Middle East and African patients is higher than that shown in white populations but still lower than the frequency reported in Asian populations.
