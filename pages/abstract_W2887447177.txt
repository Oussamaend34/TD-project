Identifying the influential spreaders in complex networks is crucial to understand who is responsible for the spreading processes and the influence maximization through networks. Targeting these influential spreaders is significant for designing strategies for accelerating the propagation of information that is useful for various applications, such as viral marketing applications or blocking the diffusion of annoying information (spreading of viruses, rumors, online negative behaviors, and cyberbullying). Existing methods such as local centrality measures like degree centrality are less effective, and global measures like closeness and betweenness centrality could better identify influential spreaders but they have some limitations. In this paper, we propose the HybridRank algorithm using a new hybrid centrality measure for detecting a set of influential spreaders using the topological features of the network. We use the SIR spreading model for simulating the spreading processes in networks to evaluate the performance of our algorithm. Empirical experiments are conducted on real and artificial networks, and the results show that the spreaders identified by our approach are more influential than several benchmarks.
