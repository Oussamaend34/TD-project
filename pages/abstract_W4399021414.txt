This research investigates the adsorption efficiency of a chitosan-bentonite (Ch–B) composite in removing methyl orange (MO), a common textile dye, from aqueous solutions. The study integrates experimental and theoretical analyses, employing density functional theory (DFT) to gain insights into the molecular interactions between the composite material and MO molecules. The Ch–B composite was characterized using various techniques, including FT-IR spectroscopy, XRD, and SEM–EDX. The experimental results indicate that the Ch–B composite exhibits a high adsorption capacity for MO, with optimal conditions identified for efficient removal. The Langmuir model was found to best fit the experimental data and the adsorption capacity was 117 mg g−1. Adsorption thermodynamics showed that the adsorption process was spontaneous, feasible, and exothermic. DFT calculation results are correlated with experimental findings to confirm theoretical predictions and improve the overall understanding of the adsorption process. Electronic structure calculations reveal the nature of the interactions between the Ch–B composite and MO molecules, including hydrogen bonds and electrostatic forces.
