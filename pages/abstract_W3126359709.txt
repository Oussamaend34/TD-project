Five novel pyrazolylnucleosides have been evaluated theoretically for their corrosion inhibition efficiency on the Cu(111) surface in acidic media. DFT calculations were carried out to exhibit the intrinsic properties such as lowest unoccupied (ELUMO) and highest occupied (EHOMO) molecular orbital energies, as well as energy gap (∆E), chemical hardness (η), chemical softness (σ), electronegativity (χ), electrophilicity (ω) and nucleophilicity (ε). The theoretical FT-IR spectra were recorded to indicate the presence of the specific bonds in the studied molecules. The surface interactions between the inhibitor molecules and the metal surface were investigated using molecular dynamics simulations and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. As a result, we have found that the inhibitor pyrazolylnucleosides 5a–e have strong interactions with Cu(111) surface, and therefore have excellent predictive inhibition power against copper corrosion.
