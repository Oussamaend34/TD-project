Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) is an economically very important and scientifically well investigated tree species of the northern hemisphere occupying large areas with different climate condition in Eurasia. It has been in the focus of tree improvement since many decades. Breeding programmes were initiated with selection of plus trees, establishment of seed orchards and progeny testing in nearly all countries where this species is of economic importance. Today these programmes are developed very differently. There are countries with advanced programmes for improvement of Scots pine and others were such programmes were stopped in the last years. In this chapter the situation of breeding of Scots pine is described for different European countries. Short overviews are given about the distribution of Scots pine, its genetic diversity, the wood production and the state of forest reproductive material of this species in Europe. This monograph contains the state of art of Scots pine breeding in different European countries. It summarizes the breeding goals, the delineation of breeding zones, different breeding methods and the achieved genetic gains. A special chapter deals with somatic embryogenesis of Scots pine. The monograph gives an outlook for further breeding activities at national and international level.
