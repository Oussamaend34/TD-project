Theupper gastrointestinal bleeding from esophageal or gastric varices is the mostdangerous complication of portal hypertension. The purpose of this study was toidentify the predictors of early rebleeding and mortality after a bleedingepisode. Patients and Methods It was a retrospective study including 215patients admitted in our department of hepatology and gastroenterology at theHassan II University Hospital of Fez, from January 2001 to January 2010.Results The mean age of our patients was 51 years. Thirty percent of patientshad cirrhosis due to virus (B or C). The majority of patients (79%) had onlyesophageal varices. Fifty patients (23%) had a bleeding recurrence. Twenty-fivepatients (11.5%) died during the first ten days, of which 52% had presentedrebleeding (p = 0.01). In 30% of cases, the rebleeding was secondary to a fallof pressure ulcers. Univariate analysis showed that early mortality of patientswas significantly associated with advanced age (p = 0.018), low prothrombintime (PT) (p = 0.022), low serum sodium (p = 0.03), low platelet count (p =0.05), and elevated transaminases (p = 0.02). Conclusion The survival ofcirrhotic patients after a bleeding episode was influenced by advanced age, alow rate of PT, of serum sodium, and of the platelet count, and elevated transaminases.
