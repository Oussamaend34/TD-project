This study addresses the critical need for efficient and sustainable methods to tackle organic pollutants and microbial contamination in water. The present work aim was to investigate the potential of multi-structured zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) for the combined photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants and antimicrobial activity. A unique fusion of precipitation-cum-hydrothermal approaches was precisely employed to synthesize the ZnO NPs, resulting in remarkable outcomes. The synthesized CTAB/ZnO NPs demonstrated exceptional properties: they were multi-structured and crystalline with a size of 40nm and possessed a narrow band gap energy of 2.82eV, enhancing light absorption for photocatalysis. These nanoparticles achieved an impressive degradation efficiency of 91.75% for Reactive Blue-81 dye within 105min under UV irradiation. Furthermore, their photocatalytic performance metrics were outstanding, including a quantum yield of 1.73 × 10–4 Φ, a kinetic reaction rate of 3.89 × 102µmolg–1h–1, a space–time yield of 8.64 × 10–6 molecules photon–1mg–1, and a figure-of-merit of 1.03 × 10–9 mol L J–1g–1h–1. Notably, the energy consumption was low at 1.73 × 10–4Jmol–1, compared to other systems. Additionally, the ZnO NPs exhibited effective antimicrobial activity against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. This research underscores the potential of tailored ZnO NPs as a versatile solution for addressing both organic pollution and microbial contamination in water treatment processes. The low energy consumption further enhances its attractiveness as a sustainable solution.
