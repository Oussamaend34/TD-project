Algorithms used for the reconstruction and identification of electrons in the central region of the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are presented in this paper; these algorithms are used in ATLAS physics analyses that involve electrons in the final state and which are based on the 2015 and 2016 proton–proton collision data produced by the LHC at $$\sqrt{s}$$ s = 13 $$\text {TeV}$$ TeV . The performance of the electron reconstruction, identification, isolation, and charge identification algorithms is evaluated in data and in simulated samples using electrons from $$Z \rightarrow ee$$ Z → e e and $$J/\psi \rightarrow ee$$ J / ψ → e e decays. Typical examples of combinations of electron reconstruction, identification, and isolation operating points used in ATLAS physics analyses are shown.
