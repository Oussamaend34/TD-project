Novel pentafunctional epoxy resin, mainly based on pentaglycidyl ether pentabisphenol A of phosphorus (PGEPBAP) has been synthesized and characterized through different spectroscopic methods (FTIR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR and 31P NMR). Moreover, the analysis of the viscosity of (PGEPBAP/Methanol) system was determined by using viscosimeter VB-1423 of the Ubbelohde type. Furthermore, the analysis of the rheological properties of the matrix PGEPBAP and their (PGEPBAP/MDA/PN) elaborated composite was performed according the RHM01-RD HAAKE rheometer. In addition, the morphology of different (PGEPBAP/MDA/PN) prepared composite was determined by using the polarizing optical microscope.
