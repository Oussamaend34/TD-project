Measurements of the azimuthal anisotropy in lead–lead collisions at $$\sqrt{s_{_\text {NN}}}$$ s NN = 5.02 TeV are presented using a data sample corresponding to 0.49 $${\mathrm {nb}}^{-1}$$ nb - 1 integrated luminosity collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in 2015. The recorded minimum-bias sample is enhanced by triggers for “ultra-central” collisions, providing an opportunity to perform detailed study of flow harmonics in the regime where the initial state is dominated by fluctuations. The anisotropy of the charged-particle azimuthal angle distributions is characterized by the Fourier coefficients, $$v_{2}$$ v 2 – $$v_{7}$$ v 7 , which are measured using the two-particle correlation, scalar-product and event-plane methods. The goal of the paper is to provide measurements of the differential as well as integrated flow harmonics $$v_{n}$$ v n over wide ranges of the transverse momentum, 0.5 $$<p_{\mathrm{T}}<$$ < p T < 60 GeV, the pseudorapidity, $$|\eta |<$$ | η | < 2.5, and the collision centrality 0–80%. Results from different methods are compared and discussed in the context of previous and recent measurements in Pb+Pb collisions at $$\sqrt{s_{_\text {NN}}}$$ s NN = 2.76 $$\mathrm{TeV}$$ TeV and 5.02 $$\mathrm{TeV}$$ TeV . In particular, the shape of the $$p_{\mathrm{T}}$$ p T dependence of elliptic or triangular flow harmonics is observed to be very similar at different centralities after scaling the $$v_{n}$$ v n and $$p_{\mathrm{T}}$$ p T values by constant factors over the centrality interval 0–60% and the $$p_{\mathrm{T}}$$ p T range 0.5 $$< p_{\mathrm{T}}<$$ < p T < 5 GeV.
