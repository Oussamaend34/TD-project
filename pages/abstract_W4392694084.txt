In the present study, micromechanical modeling techniques were employed to examine the mechanical properties of a hemp/clay composite material. This composite consists of hemp fibers incorporated into a clay matrix, a configuration chosen in response to environmental considerations and the natural advantages of hemp fibers, which include their lightweight nature and their considerable strength and stiffness relative to their weight. The approach adopted incorporates both localization and homogenization methodologies along with the three-phase model to provide an in-depth analysis of the composite's behavior. The findings from this theoretical model show a promising correlation with empirical data, demonstrating the model's efficacy in capturing the composite's mechanical response.
