A composite genetic melon map was generated based on two recombinant inbred line (RI) populations. By analyzing the segregation of 346 AFLPs, 113 IMAs and phenotypic characters on a RI population of 163 individuals derived from the cross Védrantais × PI 161375, a first map was constructed. About 20% of the molecular markers were skewed, and the residual heterozygosity was estimated at 4.43% which was not significantly different from the theoretical value of 4.2%. The genome distribution of molecular markers among the 12 linkage groups was not different from a random distribution with the exception of linkage group XII which was found significantly less populated. The genome distributions of IMAs and AFLPs were complementary. AFLPs were found mainly in the middle of each linkage group and sometimes clustered, whereas IMAs were found mainly at the end. A total of 318 molecular markers, mainly AFLP and IMA markers, were mapped on 63 RIs of the second population, Védrantais × PI 414723. Comparison of the maps enables one to conclude that AFLPs and IMAs of like molecular size, amplified with the same primer combination, correspond to the same genetic locus. Both maps were joined through 116 common markers comprising 106 comigrating AFLPs/IMAs, plus five SSRs and five phenotypic markers. The integrated melon map contained 668 loci issuing from the segregation of 1,093 molecular markers in the two RI populations. The composite map spanned 1,654 cM on 12 linkage groups which is the haploid number of chromosomes in melon. Thirty two known-function probes, i.e. known-function genes (9) and morphological traits (23), were included in this map. In addition, the composite map was anchored to previously published maps through SSRs, RFLPs and phenotypic characters.
