Informatization of education has entailed significant changes in the issue of organization, content, use of methods and means of learning. Along with these changes there is a need for personality-oriented, individual learning. The merging of e-learning and individual learning allows to automate the process of developing individual educational trajectories, which implies a personal way to realize the personal potential of each student in joint activities with the teacher. Thanks to the LMS Moodle and the creation of e-courses on its basis, the teacher can easily organize learning on individual trajectories and optimize the learning process, taking into account the intellectual, mental and physical characteristics of students. In this paper, the authors formulated the concept of reverse programming, designed to implement the logic of learning by individual trajectory in LMS Moodle. The concept of reverse programming allowed to implement in practice the logic of passing through individual learning trajectories, using the settings of LMS Moodle. In this study, learning along individual trajectories is driven by test results and the mode of access to learning material determined by the logic functionality of LMS Moodle. #COMESYSO1120.
