Abstract This study focuses on the design of highly hydrophobic polyester fabrics (PET) coated with organophilic graphene nanosheets (G-ODA) through a simple, cost-effective and scalable coating method. The organophilic graphene oxide was successfully synthesized by covalently grafting a long chain fatty amine on its surface and was fully characterized by various physicochemical techniques. G-ODA was coated at different loadings onto the PET fabric ranging from 1 to 7 wt% to produce uniformly dispersed PET@G-ODA fabrics with multifunctional performances. FTIR has confirmed the formation of strong interfacial interaction between the PET and G-ODA functional groups. Moreover, the produced PET@G-ODA fabrics resulted in achieving enhanced thermal stability as well as excellent water repellency compared to the pristine PET. Water contact angle measurements showed a tremendous enhancement of surface hydrophobicity up to 148° with 7 wt% loading of G-ODA. Tensile strength tests revealed that our fabric exhibited excellent mechanical properties compared to neat PET. In addition, the designed PET@G-ODA fabrics demonstrated excellent oil/water separation efficiency for different oil/water mixtures. The obtained results are very promising in terms of designing and producing functional PET fabrics with improved thermal and surface proprieties.
