Clubroot, caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae, is a damaging disease of Brassica napus. Genetic control and mapping of loci involved in high and partial quantitative resistance expressed against two single spore isolates (Pb137–522 and K92–16) were studied in the F1 and DH progenies of the cross Darmor-bzh (resistant) x Yudal (susceptible). The high level of resistance expressed by Darmor-bzh to isolate Pb137–522 was found to be mainly due to a major gene, which we have named Pb-Bn1, located on linkage group (LG) DY4. Partial quantitative resistance showed by Darmor-bzh to the K92–16 isolate arose from the association of at least two additive QTLs detected on LGs DY4 and DY15; the QTL on DY4, explaining 19% of the variance, was mapped at the same position as the major gene Pb-Bn1. Epistatic interactions between nine regions with or without additive effects were detected. The total phenotypic variation accounted for by additive and epistatic QTLs ranged from 62% to 81% depending on the isolate. For one isolate, the relative effect due to additivity was similar to that due to epistasis.
