Abstract: Lately in Europe, we have seen a spectacular political and electoral increase of the far-right forces, which are racist, xenophobic, fascist or semi-fascist. Such a phenomenon cannot be explained solely by the economic crisis, since in two of the most affected countries - Portugal and Spain - the far-right force's presence is little in the political scene, while it has a very significant role in countries which did not suffer a lot because of such a crisis (Switzerland, Austria). In Brazil we do not have racist parties, the far-right force manifests itself in the calling of a military coup. Keywords:Far-right; Fascism; Racism; Coup
