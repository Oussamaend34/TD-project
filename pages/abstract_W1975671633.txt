In this paper, we present an improved and discrete version of the Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithm to solve the famous traveling salesman problem (TSP), an NP-hard combinatorial optimisation problem. CS is a metaheuristic search algorithm which was recently developed by Xin-She Yang and Suash Deb in 2009, inspired by the breeding behaviour of cuckoos. This new algorithm has proved to be very effective in solving continuous optimisation problems. We now extend and improve CS by reconstructing its population and introducing a new category of cuckoos so that it can solve combinatorial problems as well as continuous problems. The performance of the proposed discrete cuckoo search (DCS) is tested against a set of benchmarks of symmetric TSP from the well-known TSPLIB library. The results of the tests show that DCS is superior to some other metaheuristics.
