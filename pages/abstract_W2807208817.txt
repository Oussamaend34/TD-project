Abstract Abstract Over the years, intensive research works have been devoted to conducting polymers due to their potential application in many fields such as fuel cell, sensors, and capacitors. To improve the properties of these compounds, several new approaches have been developed which consist in combining conducting polymers and nanoparticles. Then, this review intends to give a clear overview on nanocomposites based on conducting polymers, synthesis, characterization, and their application as electrochemical sensors. For this, the paper is divided into two parts: the first part will highlight the nanocomposites synthesized by combination of carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) and conducting polymers. The preparation of polymer/CNMs such as graphene and carbon nanotube modified electrode is presented coupled with relevant applications. The second part consists of a review of nanocomposites synthesized by combination of metal nanoparticles and conducting polymers.
