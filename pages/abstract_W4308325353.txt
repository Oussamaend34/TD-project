Abstract Detecting anomalous events in videos is one of the most popular computer vision topics. It is considered a challenging task in video analysis due to its definition, which is subjective or context-dependent. Various approaches have been proposed to address the anomaly detection problems. These approaches vary from hand-crafted to deep learning. Many researchers have gone into determining the best approach for effectively detecting anomalies in video streams while maintaining a low false alarm rate. The results proved that approaches based on deep learning offer very interesting results in this field. In this paper, we review a family of video anomaly detection approaches based on deep learning techniques, which are compared in terms of their algorithms and models. Moreover, we have grouped state-of-the-art methods into different categories based on the approach adopted to differentiate between normal and abnormal events, and the underlying assumptions. Furthermore, we also present publicly available datasets and evaluation metrics used in existing works. Finally, we provide a comparison and discussion on the results of various approaches according to different datasets. This paper can be a good starting point for such researchers to understand this field and review existing work related to this topic.
