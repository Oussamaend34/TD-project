Abstract This study investigates the impact of lithium doping on the structural and photophysical properties of spin-coated CsPbBr3 perovskite thin films. The deposited films display a pristine structure, preferentially growing along the (220) direction, and exhibit high-quality green photoluminescence at around 530 nm. The doping leads to an improvement in the optical properties of the films, as evidenced by a stronger photoluminescence (PL) intensity compared to undoped CsPbBr3, particularly at temperatures below 200 K. The increase in PL intensity suggests a decrease in defects and surface passivation. Additionally, the decrease in the power-law exponent β from 1.6 to 1.0 indicates a reduction in non-radiative recombination, likely due to trap states filling with free electrons induced by the doping. Overall, doping with lithium reduces non-radiative recombination, fills trap states, and reduces band tail/activation energy, leading to improved optoelectronic properties of the films. This investigation provides insights into the photophysical properties of the Li–CsPbBr3 absorber layer and the recombination mechanism, and helps to unravel new methods for the development of high-stability, high-performance perovskite thin-film solar cells and optoelectronic devices.
