Microalgae are among the oldest life forms on Earth and over centuries of evolution they have developed adaptive mechanisms that allow them to survive harsh environmental conditions, including exposure to toxic xenobiotics such as heavy metals (HMs). The response of microalgae to HM stress is like that occurring under any other stress conditions; it generally leads to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). An increased ROS level in algal cells causes alterations of various biological functions, primarily lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and nucleic acid damage. To cope with these perturbations, microalgae cells employ several self-defense mechanisms based on the action of ROS-scavenging enzymes and non-enzymatic antioxidant systems. The contribution of phytohormones to the management of oxidative stress is also one of the most important mechanisms. Although several studies suggest that microalgae are potential organisms for the phycoremediation of HMs, the mechanisms by which they cope with oxidative stress remain unclear. This review aims to (i) highlight the oxidative stress of HMs on the cells of microalgae, (ii) describe the enzymatic and biochemical mechanisms by which microalgae manage the oxidative stress, and finally (iii) point out the roles of phytohormones in the regulation of oxidative stress caused by HMs.
