In recent years, the pursuit of sustainable practices and the efficient utilization of resources has become paramount in various industries, including the food and beverage sector. One such challenge faced by the dairy industry is the management of whey, a byproduct generated during cheese and yogurt production. Historically, whey has been perceived as a discarded waste product, leading to environmental concerns due to its high organic load and disposal challenges. However, with the increasing emphasis on sustainability, researchers and industry leaders have recognized the potential of developing innovative approaches to valorize whey, transforming it into valuable products while minimizing waste and environmental impact. Essentially turning it from "gutter-to-gold. This review provides an overview of the technologies used for whey valorization, with a focus on new approaches, innovative products, and emerging perspectives. It aims to stimulate research and innovation in this critical field, fostering the development of a more sustainable and circular dairy industry.
