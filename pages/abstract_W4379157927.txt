In the field of nanotechnology, titanium dioxide nanotubes (TiO2 NTs) are one of the most valued inventions. They were discovered in 1996, and have since been used in several fields including photocatalytic degradation of pollutants, hydrogen production, and dye-sensitized solar cells. This review provides a comprehensive overview of TiO2 NTs and their synthesis methods, highlighting recent progress and modifications that improve their properties. The influence of anodization parameters, the effect of annealing temperature, and modified TiO2 NT arrays, including doping and heterostructure were discussed also in detail. In addition, this article summarizes some of the recent advances in the applications of TiO2 nanotubes in photocatalysis, hydrogen production, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC), and the detection of heavy metal ions. Finally, the existing problems and further prospects of this renascent and rapidly developing field are also briefly addressed.
