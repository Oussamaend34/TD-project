In recent years, the principles of green chemistry have evolved to encompass the synthesis and application of nanoparticles (NPs), giving rise to the concept of green NPs through the biomass conversion techniques. This comprehensive review article delves into the intersection of green chemistry and nanotechnology, providing an in-depth exploration of sustainable approaches to NPs synthesis by the utilization of biomass nature product, their versatile applications, and environmental considerations. We discuss the utilization of natural resources for biomass conversion, such as plant extracts and microorganisms, in NPs synthesis, highlighting their renewable and eco-friendly attributes. Moreover, we examine the diverse applications of green NPs across various sectors, including medicine, agriculture, and environmental remediation, emphasizing their unique properties and potential impact on sustainable development. Safety considerations and regulatory compliance related to green NPs usage are also addressed. Furthermore, we present a critical assessment of the current state of green NPs research, outlining future directions and challenges in scaling up production, standardization, toxicological studies, and life cycle assessments. This comprehensive overview offers valuable insights into the evolving field of green NPs, emphasizing the crucial role they play in advancing both nanotechnology and environmental sustainability.
