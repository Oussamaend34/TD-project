In this manuscript, we study the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of the equiatomic quaternary Heusler alloy ZnCdRhMn in the framework of the first-principle calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. In fact, we have investigated the structural, the magnetic, and the electronic properties of the Zn-based equiatomic quaternary Heusler alloy ZnCdRhMn using the ab initio method in the bases on the GGA approximation. On the other hand, the critical behavior of the equiatomic quaternary Heusler alloy ZnCdRhMn has been outlined by the Monte Carlo simulations. For this end, we apply the Metropolis algorithm. The objective of this work is to improve the competition between the austenitic and martensitic phases on the existence of magnetic and electronic properties of this alloy. The half-metallic behavior is only improved for the austenitic structure and 100% of spin polarization has been found. Moreover, a high curie temperature is found for this alloy for the austenitic phase. We can conclude that the austenitic structure of this alloy is useful for the spintronic device applications.
