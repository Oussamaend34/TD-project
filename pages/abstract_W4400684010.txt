Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women globally, necessitating the development of more effective therapeutic agents with minimal side effects. This study explores novel 1,2,4-triazine-3(2H)-one derivatives as potential inhibitors of Tubulin, a pivotal protein in cancer cell division, highlighting a targeted approach in cancer therapy. Using an integrated computational approach, we combined quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) modeling, ADMET profiling, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations to evaluate and predict the efficacy and stability of these compounds. Our QSAR models, developed through rigorous statistical analysis, revealed that descriptors such as absolute electronegativity and water solubility significantly influence inhibitory activity, achieving a predictive accuracy (R2) of 0.849. Molecular docking studies identified compounds with high binding affinities, particularly Pred28, which exhibited the best docking score of −9.6 kcal/mol. Molecular dynamics simulations conducted over 100 ns provided further insights into the stability of these interactions. Pred28 demonstrated notable stability, with the lowest root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.29 nm and root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) values indicative of a tightly bound conformation to Tubulin. The novelty of this work lies in its methodological rigor and the integration of multiple advanced computational techniques to pinpoint compounds with promising therapeutic potential. Our findings advance the current understanding of Tubulin inhibitors and open avenues for the synthesis and experimental validation of these compounds, aiming to offer new solutions for breast cancer treatment.
