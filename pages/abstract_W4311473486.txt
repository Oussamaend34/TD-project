During service in outdoor environments, or in some application fields, 3D printed polymer-based materials are exposed to various environmental conditions such as moisture, heat, and chemical solvents that may cause significant degradation in properties. The durability of 3D printed high-performance polymer materials under environmental conditions has become an ongoing concern for the industry and researchers due to their increasing use. This study aims to evaluate the effects of physical and chemical aging on the properties of a 3D printed blend of PEEK/PEI. The structural, morphological and mechanical properties of as-printed and aged samples were studied by multiple methods, including FTIR, SEM and tensile tests. Thermal properties of samples were also evaluated through TGA, DSC and DMA analysis. Except for a slight decrease in elastic properties, the PEEK/PEI blend does not exhibit significant changes in tensile strength, degree of crystallinity and thermal properties after 1000 h of physical and chemical aging. The PEEK/PEI blend remained stable after aging under severe conditions similar to those found in a reactor nacelle, conditions to which parts produced by additive manufacturing could be subjected.
