In recent years, there has been an unprecedented rise in the performance of metal halide perovskite solar cells. The lead-free perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have drawn much research interest due to the Pb toxicity of the lead halide perovskite. CH3NH3SnI3 is a viable alternative to CH3NH3PbX3. In this work, we designed a tin-based perovskite simulated model with the novel architecture of (TCO)/buffer (TiO2)/absorber (Perovskite)/hole transport material (HTM) and analyzed using the solar cell capacitance simulator (SCAPS-1D), which is well adapted to study the photovoltaic architectures. In the paper, we studied the influences of perovskite thickness and the doping concentration on the solar cell performance through theoretical analysis and device simulation. The results are indicating that the lead-free CH3NH3SnI3 is having the greatpotential to be an absorber layer with suitable inorganic hole transport materials like CuI (PCE 23.25%), Cu2O (PCE 19.17%), organic hole transport materials like spiro-OMETAD (PCE 23.76%) and PTAA (PCE 23.74%) to achieve high efficiency. This simulation model will become a good guide for the fabrication of high efficiency tin-based perovskite solar. The results show that the lead-free CH3NH3SnI3 is a potential environmentally friendly solar cells with high efficiency.
