Metal accumulation was investigated in a range of woody species that were planted on Cd-, Zn- and Pb- polluted sites in North of France. The study is unique in that we directly compare a large number of woody species (25). The highest accumulation of Zn and Cd was found in the Salicaceae family members with up to 950 mg Zn kg−1 dry weight (DW) and 44 mg Cd kg−1 DW in leaves of Populus tremula × Populus tremuloides. Zn content was positively correlated with Cd content, both in leaves and stems. Pb concentration was generally low and was species-independent. Oak and birch species accumulated more Mn as compared to other woody species. A seasonal variation in metal accumulation could be found. Although soil compositions and metal bioavailabilities differed amongst the experimental sites chosen in this study, variation of metal concentrations within a given species was small. High bioconcentration factors for poplar and willow suggested the high potential of these species over other woody species for metal accumulation. Taken together, these data suggest that poplar and willow species are good candidates for phytoremediation programmes.
