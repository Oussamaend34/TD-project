In this paper, the main objective is the simulation of the electric supply for homes in remote areas located in Morocco (Oujda and Ouarzazate), Spain (Granada), and Algeria (Bechar). This simulation study is divided into two ideas, the first one is to optimize the hybrid system under a varied number of houses and the second part is to fix it in chosen values. This work relied on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method to optimize and analyze the proposed stand-alone photovoltaic/wind/diesel/battery hybrid system. MATLAB software is used to run the simulations and to carry out the optimal solutions of the optimized system using a developed PSO algorithm. The PSO approach contains five principal operator axes, which are problem definition, PSO initial parameters, initialization, PSO main loop, and then run of the algorithm. Optimizing the system component sizes and reaching the minimum cost of energy (COE) were the function objectives of this optimization study. Moreover, calculation of the hydrogen production from the generated energy by PV and wind systems is performed.
