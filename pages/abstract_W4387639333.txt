The Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) is a novel and innovative technology which is part of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). VANET is a network composed of a collection of vehicles and other roadside components that are interconnected wirelessly. The intention underlying the development of this technology is the improvement of the vehicle environment and the enhancement of vehicle and driver safety. Nevertheless, since VANETs operate wirelessly and under complicated conditions, they are susceptible to a variety of attacks by malicious actors. Traditional techniques such as encryption are no longer effective, so new techniques using intrusion detection systems IDS have attracted the attention of a large number of researchers. The IDS scans the entire network and identifies all the possible harmful nodes present in the network. The present paper covers the problem of the identification of attacks in VANET by using XGBoost. The effectiveness analysis of the proposed models has been realized on the NSL-KDD and 5RoutingMetrics datasets combined with various feature selection techniques Boruta and Adaptive Synthetic Sampling Approach (ADASYN). Furthermore, the acquired results are being compared to two of the last most used ensemble methods CatBoost and convolutional neural networks CNN.In comparison with the other IDSs, our model approach achieves high performance in accuracy, recall and precision.
