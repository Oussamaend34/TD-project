This paper introduces an innovative, adaptive Fractional Open-Circuit Voltage (FOCV) algorithm combined with a robust Improved Model Reference Adaptive Controller (IMRAC) for Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) in standalone photovoltaic (PV) systems. The proposed two-stage control strategy enhances energy efficiency, simplifies system operation, and addresses limitations in conventional MPPT methods, such as slow convergence, high oscillations, and susceptibility to environmental fluctuations. The first stage dynamically estimates the Maximum Power Point (MPP) voltage using a novel adaptive FOCV method, which eliminates the need for irradiance sensors or physical disconnection of PV modules. This stage incorporates a real-time adjustment of the kv factor based on variations in PV power, ensuring precise voltage estimation. In the second stage, the IMRAC controller ensures accurate tracking of the MPP by adapting swiftly to changes in irradiance and temperature, while minimizing ripple and power loss. Validation of the proposed system was carried out using Processor-in-the-Loop (PIL) testing on an Arduino Due microcontroller, showcasing real-world applicability. Comparative analysis with state-of-the-art MPPT controllers, including PO-PI, InC-SMC, FLC, and VS PO Backstepping, demonstrates superior tracking efficiency exceeding 99.49% under EN 50,530 standard test conditions. The system also maintains exceptional performance with minimal efficiency loss across a wide range of temperature and irradiance variations. By combining simplicity, robustness, and sustainability, this work establishes a cutting-edge solution for standalone PV systems, paving the way for more efficient and reliable renewable energy applications.
