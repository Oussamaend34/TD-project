In the present study, a Molecular Docking and in silico ADMET analysis were performed to identify the possible inhibitory effect of 23 molecules, pyrazole and pyrazolines derivatives, on Escherichia coli and to predict the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) properties of all compounds. According to the results, every compound examined might bind to this bacterium's active site (PDB: 1FJ4). The results obtained in silico demonstrated that Only 4 (M6, M17, M19 and M20) of the 23 compounds were selected due to their inhibitory action and proximity to the important catalytic residues Thr302, Thr300, Val270, and His298 of the major protease and could be considered as orally active drug candidates due to their physical and chemical properties. The compounds M6, M17, M19 and M20 were subjected to Lipinski’s rule of five because it has the best binding affinity score in the binding study of the compound with the protein (-9.6, −9.3, −9.5, −10.3 Kcal/mol) successively. Pyrazole derivatives and the structure of pyrazolines are also effectively discussed in this paper for potential application as antibacterial agents due to their significant inhibitory activity. We were also able to predict a new potential inhibitor against a target of interest because to the result that we obtained.
