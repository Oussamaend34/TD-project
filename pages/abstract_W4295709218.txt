Lately, due to its accessibility and eco-friendliness, walnut shell biochar (WS-BC) is gaining attention as an electrode material component in the electrochemical detection of water pollutants. The overall performance of WS-BC is reliant on the nature of raw biomass and the production methods as well. In our concept, biochar, prepared from raw walnut shell (WS) by pyrolysis, was added to a carbon paste electrode (CPE), and poly-tyrosine (p-Tyr) was electrodeposited on the surface of the BC-doped electrode. The conditions of the elaboration of the electrode, such as pH, potential, and the number of deposition cycles, pH were optimized. The obtained p-Tyr-BC-CPE platform was tested for the determination of cadmium, lead, copper, and mercury ions in water and soil samples, using square wave voltammetry (SWV). The raw WS biomass and its BC were examined by thermal analysis (TG-DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX) techniques. The synergistic effects of the coexistence of the WS-BC and the thin film of p-Tyr, for the detection of traces of heavy metal ions were investigated by electrochemical tests. The electrochemical characterization of the unmodified and modified electrodes was performed using the cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods, while the Cd2+, Pb2+, Cu2+, and Hg2+ detection experiments were studied using the CV and SWV techniques. The optimized experimental conditions for the p-Tyr-BC-CPE platform were evaluated. The obtained electrochemical results showed that the p-Tyr-BC-CPE platform produced excellent sensitivity toward the heavy metal ions: LOD of 0.086, 0.175, 0.246, and 0.383 nM for Cd(II), Pb(II), Cu(II) and Hg(II), respectively. The modified electrode platform displayed high selectivity, stability, and good reproducibility.
