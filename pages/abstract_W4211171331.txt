MHD Natural convection, which is one of the principal types of convective heat transfer in numerous research of heat exchangers and geothermal energy systems, as well as nanofluids and hybrid nanofluids. This work focuses on the investigation of Natural convective heat transfer evaluation inside a porous triangular cavity filled with silver-magnesium oxide/water hybrid nanofluid [H2O/Ag-MgO]hnf under a consistent magnetic field. The laminar and incompressible nanofluid flow is taken to account while Darcy–Forchheimer model takes account of the advection inertia effect in the porous sheet. Controlled equations of the work have been approached nondimensional and resolved by Galerkin finite element technique. The numerical analyses were carried out by varying the Darcy, Hartmann, and Rayleigh numbers, porosity, and characteristics of solid volume fraction and flow fields. Further, the findings are reported in streamlines, isotherms and Nusselt numbers. For this work, the parametric impact may be categorized into two groups. One of them has an effect on the structural factors such as triangular form and scale on the physical characteristics of the important outputs such as fluidity and thermal transfer rates. The significant findings are the parameters like Rayleigh and slightly supported by Hartmann along with Darcy number, minimally assists by solid-particle size and rotating factor as clockwise assists the cooler flow at the center and anticlockwise direction assists the warmer flow. Clear raise in heat transporting rate can be obtained for increasing solid-particle size.
