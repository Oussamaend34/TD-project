Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), known as a class of anionic clays, have attracted considerable attention recently due to their potential applications in different areas as catalyst materials, energy materials, and adsorbent materials for environmental remediation, especially for anionic pollutant removal. In this study, magnesium aluminum layered double hydroxide (MgAl-LDH) was synthesized by two methods: standard coprecipitation and urea hydrolysis. Their textural properties and morphologies were examined by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetry (TG) and differential (DTG) analysis, and point of zero charge (pHpzc). The specific surface area was calculated from BET adsorption equation. The results indicated that the crystallinity and the regularity of the samples prepared by urea hydrolysis were much preferable to those prepared by the coprecipitation method. Their sorption properties toward phosphate were investigated and the experimental evidence showed that, at the initial concentration of 100 mg L−1 and at room temperature, the LDH synthesized by urea hydrolysis had a percentage removal of 94.3 ± 1.12% toward phosphate ions while 74.1 ± 1.34% were uptaked by LDH synthesized by coprecipitation method, suggesting that the crystallinity affects the sorption capability. The sorption mechanism indicates that phosphate ions could be sorbed onto LDHs via electrostatic attraction, ligand exchange, and ion exchange.
