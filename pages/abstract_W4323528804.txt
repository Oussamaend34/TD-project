Adaptations in wetlands are exceptionally powerful and have been evaluated using a variety of information using a few strategies (examination of authentic maps, correlation of topographic maps, translation of photographs, etc.). The Chaâba El Hamra plain is deeply compromised by the water contamination identified with synthetic substances, waste water and high wastage discharges and the concentrated use of compost. It is useful to verify the nature of the water resources. This verification requires taking into account the guide for defence against groundwater contamination while relying on advanced information from the territory model and exogenous information, for example, terrain, and climate, soil and source information. Using the state of the hydrological equilibrium and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), we were able to plot the volumes of runoff and invasion in the watersheds of the Chaâba El Hamra plain and assess the effect of urban sprawl on the waters of the investigation area. The objective of this work is, on the one hand, to assess the impact of the release on the physico-chemical nature of the water in the wells of the investigation site and, again, to decide on the state of the water table in the area of the release. The results obtained showed that the groupings of the components considered (metals and contamination markers) fluctuate according to the surface area of the wells in the groundwater and that the groundwater was expelled to the discharge.
