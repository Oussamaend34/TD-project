Polysaccharides extracted from seaweeds can function as plant biostimulants. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of Polysaccharide Enriched Extracts (PEEs) obtained from 17 Moroccan seaweeds, on tomato seed germination and plant growth. Three concentrations (0.02, 0.05 and 0.1 mg mL−1) of PEEs were applied to tomato seeds to evaluate their effect on 3 germination parameters: germination percentage (GP), germination speed (GS) and mean germination time (MGT). Metabolomic analysis by GC–MS was subsequently performed on seedlings. In the second experiment, four PEEs concentrations (0.02, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 mg mL−1) were used as foliar spray or as soil application to tomato plants. Their growth parameters (number of leaves, shoot length, fresh and dry weight of stem and roots) and biochemical parameters (chlorophyll a and b) were measured. Results indicated a significant increase of GP and GS associated with a significant reduction of MGT of tomato seeds treated with 0.02 mg mL−1 of PEEs obtained from Gigartina sp., Gigartina pistillata, Chondracanthus acicularis, Gelidium crinale, Schizymenia dubyi, Cystoseira. foeniculacea and Fucus spiralis. Similar results were also obtained by application of higher PEEs concentration (0.1 mg mL−1) extracted from Ulva rigida, Codium tomentosum, Codium decorticatum and Bifurcaria bifurcata. Metabolomic analysis on seedlings detected the presence of some metabolites which could possibly be involved in seed germination enhancement or inhibition. The results of the second experiment showed that the same PEEs cited above at the same concentrations enhanced plant dry weight and chlorophyll a content except Gigartina sp., C. foeniculacea and C. decorticatum. Furthermore, soil application of PEEs was more effective in improving plant growth parameters than foliar application. The study shows the potential of PEEs from Moroccan seaweed to be used as biostimulants for a sustainable agriculture.
