Photovoltaic (PV) energy is a renewable and permanent source of electricity available all the time. Nowadays, the solar energy integration presents an active research area due to its random and intermittent behavior. In fact, PV power prediction is valuable because it avoids complex mathematical modeling to calculate the output of a PV generator, and solves the problem of weather data uncertainty characterized by the future’s ignorance. To this goal, we present in this paper a novel solar power prediction model based on stacked Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) deep learning model and the Extreme Learning Machine algorithm (ELM). The BiLSTM is used to predict each input weather data that affect directly the output PV power (radiation, temperature, humidity and wind speed). Then, an improved ELM algorithm is proposed and served as the main prediction model that forecast the next PV power generated based on the predicted weather data. Real data is used in this paper to test the effectiveness of the proposed prediction model whose superiority is proved through the test period. The forecasting model better performs compared to other related algorithms designed to the prediction of produced PV power.
