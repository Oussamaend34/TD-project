In hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L. em. Thell), ten members of the IWMMN (International Wheat Microsatellites Mapping Network) collaborated in extending the microsatellite (SSR = simple sequence repeat) genetic map. Among a much larger number of microsatellite primer pairs developed as a part of the WMC (Wheat Microsatellite Consortium), 58 out of 176 primer pairs tested were found to be polymorphic between the parents of the ITMI (International Triticeae Mapping Initiative) mapping population W7984 × Opata 85 (ITMIpop). This population was used earlier for the construction of RFLP (Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism) maps in bread wheat (ITMImap). Using the ITMIpop and a framework map (having 266 anchor markers) prepared for this purpose, a total of 66 microsatellite loci were mapped, which were distributed on 20 of the 21 chromosomes (no marker on chromosome 6D). These 66 mapped microsatellite (SSR) loci add to the existing 384 microsatellite loci earlier mapped in bread wheat.
