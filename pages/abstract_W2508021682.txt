In this paper, we present a mathematical model with delay which describes the dynamics of three fish populations. The equilibrium points and their stability properties of the non-delay model are studied using Eigenvalue analysis. For the system with single delay model and multiple delays model, the existence of the interior equilibrium point and its stability are studied using the characteristic equation for the linearized system.
