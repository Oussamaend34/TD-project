Abstract In this study we aim to manipulate the optoelectronic and photoluminescence properties of diamond-shaped graphene quantum dots (DSGQDs) in order to make them suitable for solar cells and photovoltaic devices. Using DFT and performing many-body effects studies, we investigate the impact of N, B, O, P and S heteroatom doping on DSGQDs in three different positions, namely the zigzag edge, the armchair corner and the surface, in order to identify the most appropriate and promising configurations. All the doped GQDs are found to be chemically stable making it possible to realize them experimentally. Additionally, the obtained results show that substitution with heteroatoms has a remarkable effect on the electronic energy gap, noticeably decreasing it. Doping also has a significant effect on the optical response by shifting the absorption peaks towards the visible energy range. The excitonic behaviour has revealed that these nanostructures are potential candidates for photovoltaic devices. One can deduce that doping DSGQDs with heteroatoms is useful and promising for the targeted applications.
