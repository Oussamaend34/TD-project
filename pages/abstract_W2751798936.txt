A search for the supersymmetric partners of the Standard Model bottom and top quarks is presented. The search uses 36.1 fb−1 of pp collision data at s = 13 $$ \sqrt{s}=13 $$ TeV collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. Direct production of pairs of bottom and top squarks ( b ¯ 1 $$ {\overline{b}}_1 $$ and t ¯ 1 $$ {\overline{t}}_1 $$ ) is searched for in final states with b-tagged jets and missing transverse momentum. Distinctive selections are defined with either no charged leptons (electrons or muons) in the final state, or one charged lepton. The zero-lepton selection targets models in which the b ¯ 1 $$ {\overline{b}}_1 $$ is the lightest squark and decays via b ¯ 1 → b χ ¯ 1 0 $$ {\overline{b}}_1\to b{\overline{\chi}}_1^0 $$ , where χ ¯ 1 0 $$ {\overline{\chi}}_1^0 $$ is the lightest neutralino. The one-lepton final state targets models where bottom or top squarks are produced and can decay into multiple channels, b ¯ 1 → b χ ¯ 1 0 $$ {\overline{b}}_1\to b{\overline{\chi}}_1^0 $$ and b ¯ 1 → t χ ¯ 1 ± $$ {\overline{b}}_1\to t{\overline{\chi}}_1^{\pm } $$ , or t ¯ 1 → t χ ¯ 1 0 $$ {\overline{t}}_1\to t{\overline{\chi}}_1^0 $$ and t ¯ 1 → b χ ¯ 1 ± $$ {\overline{t}}_1\to b{\overline{\chi}}_1^{\pm } $$ , where χ ¯ 1 ± $$ {\overline{\chi}}_1^{\pm } $$ is the lightest chargino and the mass difference m χ ¯ 1 ± − m χ ¯ 1 0 $$ {m}_{{\overline{\chi}}_1^{\pm }}-{m}_{{\overline{\chi}}_1^0} $$ is set to 1 GeV. No excess above the expected Standard Model background is observed. Exclusion limits at 95% confidence level on the mass of third-generation squarks are derived in various supersymmetry-inspired simplified models.
