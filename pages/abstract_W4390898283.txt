In this study, a two pyrazole derivatives; 2-(5-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carbonyl)-N-phenylhydrazine-1-carboxamide (Pyz-1) and 4-amino-5-(5-methyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiol (Pyz-2) were synthesized and characterized by 13C-NMR, 1H-NMR, FT-IR, and mass spectrometry. A complete molecular structures optimization, electronic and thermodynamic properties of Pyz-1 and Pyz-2 in gas phase and aqueous solution were predicted by using hybrid B3LYP method with the 6-311++G** basis sets. Pyz-1 and Pyz-2 were evaluated in vitro for their anti-diabetic, antioxidant and xanthine oxidase inhibition activities. For anti-diabetic activity, Pyz-1 and Pyz-2 showed a potent α-glucosidase and α-amylase inhibition with IC50 values of 75.62 ± 0.56, 95.85 ± 0.92 and 119.3 ± 0.75, 120.2 ± 0.68µM, respectively, compared to Acarbose (IC50(α-glucosidase) = 72.58 ± 0.68µM, IC50(α-amylase) = 115.6 ± 0.574µM). In xanthine oxidase assay, Pyz-1 and Pyz-2 exhibited remarkable inhibitory ability with IC50 values 24.32 ± 0.78 and 10.75 ± 0.54µM, respectively. The result of antioxidant activities showed that the title compounds have considerable antioxidant and radical scavenger abilities. In addition, molecular docking simulation was used to determine the binding modes and energies between the title compounds and α-glucosidase and α-amylase enzymes.
