A series of ten organic dyes Ai (i=1–10) of type D–Di–π–A (i=2–10) combining various auxiliary donors (Di) with the same donor group (benzocarbazole), π-spacer (thiophene) and acceptor group (cyanoacrylic acid) have been designed and theoretically investigated using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) methods. The effects of different auxiliary donors Di (i=2–10) in D–Di–π–A dyes before and after binding to (TiO2)8 cluster on the electron injection have been studied. In this context, the electronic structures, natural bond orbital (NBO), density of states (DOS), UV–visible absorption spectra analysis, parameters influencing the short-circuit current density ( $${{J}}_{\mathrm{sc}}$$ J sc ), the open-circuit voltage ( $${\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{oc}}$$ V oc ) and the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) have been evaluated to predict the suitable candidates for DSSC device. The obtained results show that dye A7 with auxiliary donor 4,4-dimethyl-4H-cyclopentadithiophene (D7) exhibits a small band gap value (2.24 eV), a greater wavelength absorption λmax (525.98 nm), a better light-harvesting efficiency (LHE) (0.99) and a higher value of $${{\Delta}G}_{\mathrm{inject}}$$ Δ G inject (−1.30 eV). In addition, the low values for total reorganization energy (λtot) and ionization potential (IP), as well as the high value for electronic affinity (EA), reflect that the charge transport properties of this dye are the most favorable in comparison with the other dyes, implying a lower charge recombination rate, with faster charge injection and dye regeneration process. Consequently, all designed dyes, especially A7, could be the most suitable sensitizers for DSSC.
