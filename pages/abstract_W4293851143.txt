The iron-sillenite Bi25FeO40 has been synthesized using the solid-state reaction route. The elaborated material crystallizes in a cubic structure. The studied material exhibits an anomaly, noticed via the DSC analysis and dielectric measurements at 671 K. This anomaly can be attributed to the occurrence of a thermally activated relaxation in the Bi25FeO40 sample. Besides, the magnetic study revealed the antiferromagnetic behaviour of γ-Bi25FeO40 sillenite, with a 240 K of Neel temperature TN, Curie constant of 9.18 10–8 m3.K/mol, resulting in a magnetic moment of 6.37 μB. Furthermore, the band gap of Bi25FeO40 is about 2.02 eV and the magnetic behavior makes it an appropriate candidate as a photocatalyst for water and/or wastewater treatment, and degradation of pollutants, that can be simply recycled by magnetic separation.
