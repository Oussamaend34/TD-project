Abstract Using machine learning to predict students’ dropout in higher education institutions and programs has proven to be effective in many use cases. In an approach based on machine learning algorithms to detect students at risk of dropout, there are three main factors: the choice of features likely to influence a partial or total stop of the student, the choice of the algorithm to implement a prediction model, and the choice of the evaluation metrics to monitor and assess the credibility of the results. This paper aims to provide a diagnosis of machine learning techniques used to detect students’ dropout in higher education programs, a critical analysis of the limitations of the models proposed in the literature, as well as the major contribution of this arti-cle is to present recommendations that may resolve the lack of global model that can be generalized in all the higher education institutions at least in the same country or in the same university.
