Measurements of longitudinal flow correlations are presented for charged particles in the pseudorapidity range $$|\eta |<2.4$$ | η | < 2.4 using 7 and 470 $$\upmu \hbox {b}^{-1}$$ μ b - 1 of Pb+Pb collisions at $$\sqrt{s_{\text {NN}}}=2.76$$ s NN = 2.76 and 5.02 TeV, respectively, recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. It is found that the correlation between the harmonic flow coefficients $$v_n$$ v n measured in two separated $$\eta $$ η intervals does not factorise into the product of single-particle coefficients, and this breaking of factorisation, or flow decorrelation, increases linearly with the $$\eta $$ η separation between the intervals. The flow decorrelation is stronger at 2.76 TeV than at 5.02 TeV. Higher-order moments of the correlations are also measured, and the corresponding linear coefficients for the $$k{\text {th}}$$ k th -moment of the $$v_n$$ v n are found to be proportional to k for $$v_3$$ v 3 , but not for $$v_2$$ v 2 . The decorrelation effect is separated into contributions from the magnitude of $$v_n$$ v n and the event-plane orientation, each as a function of $$\eta $$ η . These two contributions are found to be comparable. The longitudinal flow correlations are also measured between $$v_n$$ v n of different order in n. The decorrelations of $$v_2$$ v 2 and $$v_3$$ v 3 are found to be independent of each other, while the decorrelations of $$v_4$$ v 4 and $$v_5$$ v 5 are found to be driven by the nonlinear contribution from $$v_2^2$$ v 2 2 and $$v_2v_3$$ v 2 v 3 , respectively.
