Salp swarm algorithm (SSA) is a recently developed meta-heuristic swarm intelligence optimization algorithm based on simulating the chain movement behavior of salps sailing and foraging in the sea. In this paper, a novel hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm called SSA-FGWO is proposed to overcome the shortcomings of the original SSA, including slow convergence speed in dealing with high-dimensional and multimodal landscapes, low precision, and global optimization problems. The essential idea of SSA-FGWO is to improve the salp swarm optimization algorithm (SSA) by utilizing the Grey Wolf Algorithm (GWO) strategy. The hybridization mechanism includes two steps: First, the strong exploitation of SSA is applied to update the leaders' position of the chain population. Second, the strong exploration strategy of GWO is used to update the followers' position to increase the population variance of the proposed optimizer. The proposed algorithm is expected to enhance exploration and exploitation ability significantly by the hybrid design. The effectiveness of SSA-FGWO is investigated through CEC2020, 23 representative benchmark cases, and feature selection problems (18 data sets) are solved. The algorithm has been examined for its computational complexity and convergent behavior. In addition to GWO, SSA and other swarm optimization algorithms are employed to compare with the proposed optimizer. The obtained experimental results show that the exploitation, exploration tendencies, and convergence patterns of SSA-FGWO have significantly improved. The results show that the proposed SSA-FGWO algorithm is a promising one that outperforms the basic SSA, GWO, and other algorithms in terms of efficacy.
