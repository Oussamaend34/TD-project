We propose a logarithmic parametrization form of energy density for the scalar field dark energy in the framework of the standard theory of gravity, which supports the necessary transition from the decelerated to the accelerated behavior of the Universe. The model under consideration is constrained by available observational data, including cosmic chronometers data-sets (CC), Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data-sets, and Supernovae (SN) data-sets, consisting of only two parameters $$\alpha $$ α and $$\beta $$ β . The combined CC+BAO+SN data-sets yields a transition redshift of $$z_{tr}=0.79^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$$ z tr = 0 . 79 - 0.02 + 0.02 , where the model exhibits signature-flipping and is consistent with recent observations. For the combined data-sets, the present value of the deceleration parameter is calculated to be $$q_{0}=-0.43^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$$ q 0 = - 0 . 43 - 0.06 + 0.06 . Furthermore, the analysis yields constraints on both the parameter density value for matter and the present value of the Hubble parameter, with values of $$\Omega _{m0}=0.25849^{+0.00026}_{-0.00025}$$ Ω m 0 = 0 . 25849 - 0.00025 + 0.00026 and $$H_{0}=67.79_{-0.59}^{+0.59}$$ H 0 = 67 . 79 - 0.59 + 0.59 km/s/Mpc, respectively, consistent with the results obtained from Planck 2018. Finally, the study investigates how the mass of a black hole evolves over time in a Universe with both matter and dark energy. It reveals that the black hole mass increases initially but stops increasing as dark energy dominates.
