Abstract A new epoxy monomer, namely, tetraglycidyl-1,2-aminobenzamide (ER), was synthesized by condensation of the amines with epichlorohydrin in a basic medium. The obtained epoxy monomer was characterized by FT-IR and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Rheological properties of this monomer were determined using an advanced rheometer. Subsequently, the synthesized ER monomer was investigated as corrosion inhibitor for carbon steel in 1 M HCl solution. The adsorption properties of ER were analyzed by electrochemical, surface investigation and theoretical computational studies using DFT and molecular dynamics (MD). Results showed a high dependence of the viscosity of ER on temperature and concentration, and also, that ER has better inhibition performance. A good agreement between the results derived from computational (MD and DFT) and experimental methods was observed. The thermodynamic parameters, along with the kinetic parameters, showed that the adsorption of ER molecules onto carbon steel surface obeyed the Langmuir isotherm model, and the adsorption at metal–electrolyte interfaces involved both chemical and physical adsorption, but predominantly chemisorption mechanism.
