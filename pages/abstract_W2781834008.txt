Abstract Herein, we report the preparation of magnetic CoFe2O4 nanoparticles and CoFe2O4/graphene oxide (GO) hybrids and evaluate their catalytic activity as heterogeneous peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activators for the decomposition of rhodamine B. The surface morphologies and structures of both CoFe2O4 nanoparticles and CoFe2O4/GO hybrids were investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms. The magnetic properties of the samples were assessed using a SQUID magnetometer at 298 K. Catalytic oxidation experiments demonstrated that CoFe2O4/GO hybrids exhibited much better catalytic activity than CoFe2O4 nanoparticles or CoFe2O4/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) hybrids, suggesting that GO plays an important role in CoFe2O4/GO hybrids in the decomposition of rhodamine B. The influence of various reaction conditions such as temperature, concentration of PMS, pH and decomposition time of rhodamine B over the CoFe2O4/GO catalyst were investigated and optimized. The rhodamine B degradation process was found to fit a pseudo-first order kinetics model. The catalyst could be easily separated from the reaction mixture by applying an external magnet. In particular, the as-prepared CoFe2O4/GO hybrid exhibited good reusability and stability in successive degradation experiments in PMS solution.
