Viticulture is a major worldwide economic sector with a vine area of 7.52 million ha, wine production of 288 Mhl, and wine exports of 26 billion euros. Nevertheless, viticulture has to adapt to new challenges of pest management, such as pesticide reduction, and climate change, such as increasing droughts. Viticulture adaptation can benefit from arbuscular mycorrhiza, a plant–fungus symbiosis. Here, we review the ecosystemic services of arbuscular mycorrhiza for grapevine production. The major points are the following: (1) arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi increase grapevine growth and nutrition by a better access to soil nutrients and by activating the regulation of plant transport proteins for phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N), and other elements. (2) Arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi increase the tolerance to abiotic stresses such as water stress, soil salinity, iron chlorosis, and heavy metal toxicity. (3) Arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi protect against biotic stresses such as root diseases. (4) Arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi produce glycoproteins and a dense hyphal network that increases soil stability and save soil nutrients up to 14 % of the grape production income. (5) P fertilisation reduces mycorhization. (6) Using herbaceous plants as cover crops favors arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi.
