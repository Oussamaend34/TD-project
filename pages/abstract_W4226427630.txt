Textile industries use large amounts of water and chemicals for finishing and dying processes. The chemical structures of dyes vary enormously, and some have complicated aromatic structures that resist degradation in conventional wastewater treatment processes because of their stability to sunlight, oxidizing agents, and microorganisms. The objective of this research is to compare the adsorption efficiency of two types of magnetic activated carbons derived from Banana peel and Salvia seed for the removal of basic blue 41 dye. The faculty of the produced activated carbons to remove basic blue 41 dye from aqueous solutions via batch adsorption has been examined under several operating conditions such as pH, adsorbent dose, initial adsorbate concentration and contact time. The cheap, non-toxic produced activated carbons (AC) were characterized by scanning electron microscope and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analyses. The best conditions of dye adsorption with BPAC@ Fe3O4 equal to pH = 9, AC dose 0.5 g/L , dye concentration 50 mg/L and equilibrium contact time 30 min, optimal dye adsorption conditions for SSAC@Fe3O4 equal to pH = 9, adsorbent dose 0.75 mg/L , dye concentration 50 mg/L and equilibrium contact time is 30 min. This study followed the Langmuir isotherm model well with regression coefficient of R2= 0.9886 for BPAC@Fe3O4 and regression coefficient of R2= 0.9764 for SSAC@Fe3O4.
