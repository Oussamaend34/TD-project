Aim To determine the effect of Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745 (S. boulardii) plus sequential therapy on Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication rate. Methods This open-label prospective study randomized (1:1) patients with confirmed H. pylori infection to standard sequential therapy of twice-daily (bid) omeprazole 20 mg plus amoxicillin 1 g for 5 days, followed by bid omeprazole 20 mg, clarithromycin 500 mg and metronidazole 500 mg for the next 5 days (control group), or sequential therapy plus bid S. boulardii 250 mg (experimental group). Adverse events (AEs) were recorded throughout the study, and the H. pylori eradication rate was determined 4 weeks after treatment. Results The study was conducted from May 2013 to May 2016 and included 199 patients (51.3% male; mean age 44.6 ± 13.6 years). The H. pylori eradication rate was higher in the experimental group than the control group (86.0% vs. 74.7%; P = 0.02). Compared with the control group, patients in the experimental group experienced a significantly lower overall incidence of AEs (17.0% vs. 55.7%; p < 0.001) and the incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (2.0% vs. 46.4%; P = 0.02). The experimental group showed improved treatment compliance over the 10-day study period compared with the control group (95.0% vs. 91.2%, P < 0.001). Conclusion Addition of S. boulardii to sequential therapy improved H. pylori eradication rate and reduced the incidence of treatment-associated AEs in Moroccan patients with H. pylori infection.
