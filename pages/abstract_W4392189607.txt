Purpose A wound is an incision or injury in the skin or tissues of the body caused by trauma, surgery, or a medical condition. One of the most complex processes in the human body is wound healing, which is achieved through hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodelling, to recover the integrity and functionality of the damaged area. Methods The review investigates the use of polymer-based hydrogel sponge in the management of wound. Results Hydrogel sponges (HS) have gained interest in wound healing because of their superior biochemical and mechanical properties in the past decade. Hydrogel sponges are three-dimensional porous structures made of hydrophilic polymers that can hold huge amounts of water or biological fluids within their structure. There is currently a lack of a thorough review that covers the various functions of HS in wound healing dressings and fills the gap in knowledge. Conclusion The present review summarizes the process of wound healing, technologies adapted in fabrication of hydrogel sponges, application of various polymers (natural and synthetic polymers) in fabrication, characterization of hydrogel sponge using different physiochemical and analytical techniques, and its biomimetic action. The major challenges and future directions in the development of hydrogel sponge for wound healing are also discussed. Lay Summary Injury from a ruptured human tissue or organ, whether internal or external, is referred as a wound. Hydrogel-based sponge is hydrophilic gels with a 3D network structure that expands fast in the presence of water, which holds significant potential in healing wounds. Graphical Abstract
