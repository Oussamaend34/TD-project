Context Forest scientists build models to simulate stand growth and forests dynamics. Dedicated computer tools are often developed to implement these models in order to run silvicultural scenarios and explore simulation results. Aims Our objective was to encourage software reuse and simplify model implementation. Methods The scheme was to develop a framework and methodology allowing to simplify the implementation, integration, simulation and comparison of forest models by providing a set of common and standard tools. Results Capsis provides an open and modular software architecture based on various components, allowing to run forest growth simulations and display the results. The benefits of this framework are shown with the Samsara2 model, an individual-based and spatialised tree model. Capsis has been used successfully in many similar projects. In addition, the Capsis methodology defines how developers, modellers and end-users may interact. Conclusion The Capsis framework facilitates collaborative and shared software development. Moreover, it is a powerful way to support scientific animation in the frame of forest science.
