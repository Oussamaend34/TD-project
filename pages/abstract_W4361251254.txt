Abstract This paper aims to answer four fundamental questions: (1) What scientific journals have published papers on the application of the Technology Acceptance Models (TAM) and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) in tourism and hospitality research? (2) In what context have the TAM and UTAUT models emerged in tourism and hospitality research? (3) Which types of TAM and UTAUT have attracted interest in tourism and hospitality research? (4) What methodologies are used in the applications of TAM and UTAUT in tourism research? The design of this study corresponds to establishing the framework for future research on TAM and UTAUT in tourism by outlining what is currently known. Based on 40 papers published between 2017 and 2022, the methodology consists of an analysis of studies that have been conducted in tourism and hospitality using technology adoption theories (TAM and UTAUT). A systematic literature review is the ideal approach for the current state with a focus on the application of the theories of TAM and UTAUT models. Based on an analysis of 40 studies, mobile applications and social media marketing emerged as the most prevalent constructs. This paper proposes a summary of potential paths for future studies, offering possibilities and guidelines.
