This work aims to prepare a series of sols based on Titanium (IV) butoxide (TBT) and using boric acid as a functional additive. The sols were applied onto the cotton fabric by the pad-pry-cure process. The as-obtained cotton fabrics were characterized using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis in order to determine their chemical composition and their surface morphology, respectively. The results indicate the formation of TiO2–boron-based coating over the surface of coated cotton fabric. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns showed that the coating did not affect the crystallographic structure of the cellulosic fabric. The functional properties of the treated samples were measured from thermo-oxidative stability and burning behavior performance, drop absorption and water uptake measurements. The results showed that the coated cotton fabrics by the sol–gel approach through the application of TiO2–boron-based coating with 2.5 molar ratio of boric acid possessed high thermal stability and flame retardancy. Most importantly, a total burning time of 2 s and a residue of more than 90% were obtained after 10 s of flame application, indicating that the functionalized cotton fabric self-extinguished the fire rapidly. The water-repellent properties were also enhanced and the obtained results mentioned that the drop time and the water uptake were improved compared with untreated cotton fabric. The effect of the application of TiO2–boron-based coatings on the mechanical properties of cotton samples, as well as their washing fastness were studied.
