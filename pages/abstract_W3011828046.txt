In this work, we search to show the influence of the wind speed on the annual fishing effort, catches and profit of seiners, and show that these parameters are the most important parameters involved in seiner’s fishing activity. To achieve this objective, we consider a bioeconomic system of marine populations exploited, in the southern Atlantic zone of Morocco, by seiner fleets. In this paper, we show that our model is stable. After, we move to calculate the fishing effort and the amount of catch that allows seiners to have a maximum annual profit under the two constraints: the changes of wind speed and the sustainability of the marine populations stocks. Also we compare the obtained results with those given by National Institute of Fisheries Research.
