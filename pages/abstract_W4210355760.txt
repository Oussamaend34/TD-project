The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system that allows physical objects that have computer processing and sensory communication systems to connect mutually and take advantage of some service on the Internet. In fact, the philosophy of adopting IoT is to make devices connected to the Internet, and users can access data more quickly. The wide spectrum of possible IoT applications includes the field of agriculture, for which significant exploitation of IoT is envisaged in the long term. Furthermore, the advancements in the field of sensor technology provide us the opportunity to discover situations that were totally unachievable in earlier times. This has given us the idea to use IoT to design an innovative system for real-time farm monitoring and controlling. The planned solution concerns farmers and farm employees. In fact, it is capable to help them and make their work easier by controlling products remotely from time to time.
