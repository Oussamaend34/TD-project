The most common and effective way to control phoma stem canker (blackleg) caused by Leptosphaeria maculans in oilseed rape (Brassica napus) is through the breeding of resistant cultivars. Race specific major genes that mediate resistance from the seedling stage have been identified in B. napus or have been introgressed from related species. Many race specific major genes have been described and some of them are probably identical in B. napus (allotetraploid AACC) and the parental species B. rapa (diploid AA). More work is needed using a set of well-characterised isolates to determine the number of different major resistance genes available. In some B. napus cultivars, there is resistance which is polygenic (mediated by Quantitative Trait Loci) and postulated to be race non-specific. Many of these major genes and Quantitative Trait Loci for resistance to L. maculans have been located on B. napus genetic maps. Genes involved in race specific and polygenic resistance are generally distinct.
