Purpose The aim of this study is to evaluate the frequency and nature of chromosomal abnormalities in Moroccan couples with recurrent spontaneous miscarriage (RSM). In addition, the data were compared with those reported elsewhere in order to give a global estimation of chromosomal abnormalities frequencies. Methods The study was performed for all couples with RSM who were referred to the cytogenetic department, Pasteur Institute of Morocco, from different hospitals in Morocco between 1996 and 2016. Cytogenetic analysis was performed according to the standard method. Results Among 627 couples with RSM, the chromosomal abnormalities were identified in 11.00% of couples, with chromosomal inversions in 4.30%, reciprocal translocations in 2.71%, Robertsonian translocations in 1.43%, and deletion, isochromosome, and insertion in 0.15% each. The insertion identified [46,XX,ins(6)(p24q21q27)] is new, and is the fourth reported in association with RSM. The mosaic karyotypes were observed in 0.64%, polymorphic variants were identified in 1.27%, and numerical aneuploidy was observed in 0.15%. In regrouping our results with those in 27 other studies already published in 21 different countries, we obtained the frequency of chromosomal abnormalities in couple with RSM to be 5.16% (991/19197 couples). The reciprocal translocation was the most frequent with 2.50%, followed by Robertsonian translocation 0.83% and inversions 0.77%. The other types of chromosomal abnormalities were present with 0.98% in the world. Conclusion This data showed that the frequency of chromosomal abnormalities in Moroccan couples with RSM is 11.00%, and in regrouping our results with other studies, the frequency changes to 5.16%.
