Chromium is a naturally occurring element found in rocks, animals, plants, soil and in volcanic dust and gases. It exists in different oxidation states that range from +2 to +6. The most stable forms are Cr(VI) and Cr(III), although they significantly differ in biological, geochemical and toxicological properties. Cr(III) occurs naturally in the environment at a narrow concentration range and is considered to be less toxic than Cr(VI). Hexavalent chromium is used extensively in industrial processes such as electroplating, tanning, textile dyeing, corrosion inhibition and wood treatment, all of which produce discharge of chromium-containing effluents (Lauwerys et al. 2007). The high solubility of Cr(VI) makes it a hazardous contaminant of water and soil when discharged by industries that produce or utilize chromium. When it is released to the environment, Cr(VI) is a potential contaminant of groundwater that can participate in trophic transfer in food chains. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has identified Cr(VI) as one of the 17 chemicals posing the greatest threat to humans (Marsh and McInerney 2001). The permissible limit for total chromium in drinking water is 0.05 mg/L (WHO 2004).
