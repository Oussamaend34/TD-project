Lead-free halide double perovskites (HDPs) have emerged as aspirant members of the optoelectronic and thermoelectric (TE) materials family due to their non-toxicity, tunable and noticeable performances. Herein, the structural, mechanical, thermodynamic, optoelectronic, and TE properties of novel Rb2CuMF6 (M = As3+, Bi3+) HDPs are comprehensively investigated. This study has been performed using accurate first principle calculations with the Boltzmann transport theory. The evaluated elastic constants ensure their structural and thermal stability in cubic phase and anisotropic with ductile behavior. Using Tran-Balaha modified Becke-Johnson (TB-mBJ-GGA) potential, indirect semiconducting band gaps of 1.43 eV and 1.27 eV are recorded for Rb2CuAsF6, and Rb2CuBiF6, respectively. Correlated analyses of the wavelength-dependent optical properties are conducted. The studied HDPs exhibited different optical absorption abilities in both UV and VIS working regions. Besides, the entire TE properties are addressed for n- and p-type doping in a wide operating temperature range. The p-type doping is found to be effective in enhancing the TE performances of both HDPs. The highest figure of merit (ZT)max = 0.994 is recorded at 300 K for intrinsic Rb2CuMF6 (M = As3+, Bi3+). Accordingly, the favorable combination of the present outcomes makes Rb2CuMF6 (M = As3+, Bi3+) an interesting candidate for widespread optoelectronic and TE applications in a wide working temperature range.
