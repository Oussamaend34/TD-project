Hydrochar derived from Argan nut shell (ANS) was synthesized and applied to remove bisphenol A (BPA) and diuron. The results indicated that the hydrochar prepared at 200 °C (HTC@ANS-200) possessed a higher specific surface area (42 m2/g) than hydrochar (HTC@ANS-180) prepared at 180 °C (17 m2/g). The hydrochars exhibited spherical particles, which are rich in functional groups. The HTC@ANS-200 exhibited high adsorption efficiency, of about 92% of the BPA removal and 95% of diuron removal. The maximum Langmuir adsorption capacities of HTC@ANS-200 at room temperature were 1162.79 mg/for Bisphenol A and 833.33 mg/g for diuron (higher than most reported adsorbents). The adsorption process was spontaneous (− ΔG°) and exothermic (− ΔH°). Excellent reusability was reclaimed after five cycles, the removal efficiency showed a weak decrease of 4% for BPA and 1% for diuron. The analysis of Fourier transforms infrared spectrometry demonstrated that the aromatic C=C and OH played major roles in the adsorption mechanisms of BPA and diuron in this study. The high adsorption capacity was attributed to the beneficial porosity (The pore size of HTC@ANS-200 bigger than the size of BPA and diuron molecule) and surface functional groups. BPA and diuron adsorption occurred also via multiple adsorption mechanisms, including pore filling, π–π interactions, and hydrogen bonding interactions on HTC@ANS-200.
