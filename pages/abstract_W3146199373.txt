Several new technologies such as the smart cities, the Internet of Things (IoT), and 5G Internet need services offered by cloud computing for processing and storing more information. Hence, the heterogeneity of the new companies that used the above-mentioned technologies will add many vulnerabilities and security concerns for the cloud paradigm. Presently, cloud computing involves every component such as end-user, networks, access management, and infrastructures. Without a lucid vision of the cloud infrastructure, security communities struggle with problems ranging from duplicating data to failing to identify security threats in a timely way, with loss of control about protection and data access to face regulatory compliance. With cloud computing becoming part of our everyday life and our digital computer environment, we look forward to rapid new development in the computational needs provided by cloud computing paradigms. In this paper, we first provide an architecture tutorial on cloud computing technology, including their essential characteristics, services models, deployment models, and cloud data center virtualization. Second, we provide the cloud computing security issues and frameworks, and through a comprehensive survey, we characterize and summarize the efforts made in the literature to find solutions to these security issues. Third, we categorize the various attacks in the cloud and privacy challenges. Fourth, we summarize the efforts made in the literature to the defense mechanisms and mitigation solution for security assessment. Finally, we discuss open issues in cloud security and propose some future directions.
