High-capacity Ni-rich layered oxides are promising cathode materials for secondary lithium-based battery systems. However, their structural instability detrimentally affects the battery performance during cell cycling. Here, we report an Al/Zr co-doped single-crystalline LiNi0.88Co0.09Mn0.03O2 (SNCM) cathode material to circumvent the instability issue. We found that soluble Al ions are adequately incorporated in the SNCM lattice while the less soluble Zr ions are prone to aggregate in the outer SNCM surface layer. The synergistic effect of Al/Zr co-doping in SNCM lattice improve the Li-ion mobility, relief the internal strain, and suppress the Li/Ni cation mixing upon cycling at high cut-off voltage. These features improve the cathode rate capability and structural stabilization during prolonged cell cycling. In particular, the Zr-rich surface enables the formation of stable cathode-electrolyte interphase, which prevent SNCM from unwanted reactions with the non-aqueous fluorinated liquid electrolyte solution and avoid Ni dissolution. To prove the practical application of the Al/Zr co-doped SNCM, we assembled a 10.8 Ah pouch cell (using a 100 μm thick Li metal anode) capable of delivering initial specific energy of 504.5 Wh kg−1 at 0.1 C and 25 °C. Li-ion cathode active materials are transitioning from poly- to single-crystal structures. However, the performance of high Ni-content single-crystal cathodes remains below expectations. Here, via Al/Zr co-doping, the authors propose a strategy to mitigate structural degradation in this class of materials.
