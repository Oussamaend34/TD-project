A measurement of fiducial and differential cross-sections for $$W^+W^-$$ W + W - production in proton–proton collisions at $$\sqrt{s}=13$$ s = 13 TeV with the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 $$\hbox {fb}^{-1}$$ fb - 1 is presented. Events with one electron and one muon are selected, corresponding to the decay of the diboson system as $$WW\rightarrow e^{\pm }\nu \mu ^{\mp }\nu $$ W W → e ± ν μ ∓ ν . To suppress top-quark background, events containing jets with a transverse momentum exceeding 35 GeV are not included in the measurement phase space. The fiducial cross-section, six differential distributions and the cross-section as a function of the jet-veto transverse momentum threshold are measured and compared with several theoretical predictions. Constraints on anomalous electroweak gauge boson self-interactions are also presented in the framework of a dimension-six effective field theory.
