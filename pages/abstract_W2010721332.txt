We have evaluated three DNA-based marker types for linkage map construction in Populus: RFLPs detected by Southern blot hybridization, STSs detected by a combination of PCR and RFLP analysis, and RAPDs. The mapping pedigree consists of three generations, with the F1 produced by interspecific hybridization between a P. trichocarpa female and a P. deltoides male. The F2 generation was made by inbreeding to the maximum degree permitted by the dioecious mating system of Populus. The applicability of STSs and RAPDs outside the mapping pedigree has been investigated, showing that these PCR-based marker systems are well-suited to breeding designs involving interspecific hybridization. A Populus genome map (343 markers) has been constructed from a combination of all three types. The length of the Populus genome is estimated to be 2400–2800 cM.
