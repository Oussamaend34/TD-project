The dominating features of new class of tri-hybrid nanofluid like that more heat transport rates, thermal conductivity and good electrical, and low cost had been favorably attractive the consideration of entire investigators. In view of these awesome aspects, the present numerical study analyzed the impact on Ohmic heating of magneto-Carreau tri-hybrid nanofluid ( $${\text{Fe}}_{3} {\text{O}}_{4} + {\text{Cu}} + {\text{Au}}/$$ Fe 3 O 4 + Cu + Au / water) flow through an elongating surface within permeable media. Further, suction or injection into boundary layer flow in the absence of nonlinear thermal radiation was scrutinized. This bvp4c method was equipped to acquire the mathematical outcomes on built in numerical form along the help of MATLAB software. The physical significant quantities like that wall shear stress and heat transport coefficient were calculated vs controlling constraints, and the outcomes were outlined on the tables and depicted graphically also. The outcomes reveal that the thermal behavior on the structure increases in the absence of nanoparticles, thermal radiation and viscous dissipations. Therefore, this velocity on the fluid raises when the added on nanoparticles. The outcomes of this study can be helpful functions on engineering and material science.
