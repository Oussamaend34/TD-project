Abstract Heart rate variability (HRV) is widely recognized as an effective and valuable tool for evaluating cardiac autonomic modulation. However, various factors can influence HRV before and during assessment, complicating the interpretation and comparability of results. This review outlines the different factors affecting HRV and underscores the importance of considering them to ensure consistent and reliable HRV outcomes. Key influencing factors are categorized into physiological (e.g., age, gender, genetics), lifestyle (e.g., physical activity, alcohol use, smoking, drugs, diet), environmental (e.g., time of day, temperature, noise), and methodological (e.g., body position, recording duration, and respiration) domains. Knowing these factors can help researchers and physicians gain a better understanding of HRV and improve the interpretation of their findings. Consequently, this can lead to the development of standardized methods for consistently assessing and interpreting HRV measures in clinical practice.
