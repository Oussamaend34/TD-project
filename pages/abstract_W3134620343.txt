Author summary Why was this study done? Every year, millions of people become infected with influenza viruses, which infect the airways and cause symptoms that include a fever, tiredness and weakness, general aches and pains, sore throat, and cough. Most infected individuals recover quickly, but some develop more severe illness such as pneumonia, and may require hospitalization. Influenza vaccination can prevent infections and severe disease, but decisions on how to prioritize risk groups, particularly in limited-resource settings, require a robust evidence base, including global, regional, and local data.
