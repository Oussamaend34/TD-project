Abstract Capsicum resistance to Pepper veinal mottle virus (PVMV) results from complementation between the pvr2 and pvr6 resistance genes: recessive alleles at these two loci are necessary for resistance, whereas any dominant allele confers susceptibility. In line with previous results showing that pvr2 resistance alleles encode mutated versions of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), the involvement of other members of the eIF4E multigenic family in PVMV resistance was investigated. It was demonstrated that pvr6 corresponds to an eIF(iso)4E gene, predicted to encode the second cap-binding isoform identified in plants. Comparative genetic mapping in pepper and tomato indicated that eIF(iso)4E maps in the same genomic region as pvr6. Sequence analysis revealed an 82 nt deletion in eIF(iso)4E cDNAs from genotypes with the pvr6 resistance allele, leading to a truncated protein. This deletion was shown to co-segregate with pvr6 in doubled haploid and F2 progeny. Transient expression in a PVMV-resistant genotype of eIF(iso)4E derived from a genotype with the pvr6 + susceptibility allele resulted in loss of resistance to subsequent PVMV inoculation, confirming that pvr6 encodes the translation factor eIF(iso)4E. Similarly, transient expression of eIF4E from a genotype with the pvr2 + -eIF4E susceptibility allele also resulted in loss of resistance, demonstrating that wild-type eIF4E and eIF(iso)4E are susceptibility factors for PVMV and that resistance results from the combined effect of mutations in the two cap-binding isoforms. Thus, whilst most potyviruses specifically require one eIF4E isoform to perform their replication cycle, PVMV uses either eIF4E or eIF(iso)4E for infection of pepper.
