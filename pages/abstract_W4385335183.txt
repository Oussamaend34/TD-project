Salinity is one of the most significant environmental factors limiting legumes development and productivity. Salt stress disturbs all developmental stages of legumes and affects their hormonal regulation, photosynthesis and biological nitrogen fixation, causing nutritional imbalance, plant growth inhibition and yield losses. At the molecular level, salt stress exposure involves large number of factors that are implicated in stress perception, transduction, and regulation of salt responsive genes’ expression through the intervention of transcription factors. Along with the complex gene network, epigenetic regulation mediated by non-coding RNAs, and DNA methylation events are also involved in legumes’ response to salinity. Different alleviation strategies can increase salt tolerance in legume plants. The most promising ones are Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobia, Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi, seed and plant’s priming. Genetic manipulation offers an effective approach for improving salt tolerance. In this review, we present a detailed overview of the adverse effect of salt stress on legumes and their molecular responses. We also provide an overview of various ameliorative strategies that have been implemented to mitigate/overcome the harmful effects of salt stress on legumes.
