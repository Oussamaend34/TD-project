This study is devoted to explore the physical aspects of wormhole geometry under embedded class-1 spacetime in $$f(T,\tau )$$ f ( T , τ ) gravity, where $$\tau $$ τ denotes the trace of the energy-momentum tensor and T is the torsion. We derive the embedded class-1 solutions by considering spherically symmetric static spacetime. The shape function is calculated in the framework of embedded class-1 spacetime. It is necessary to mention here that the calculated shape function can be used in other modified theories of gravity. To complete this study, we take diagonal and off-diagonal tetrad, and try to build a comparison by considering the validity region of energy conditions in embedded class-1 spacetime. The embedded surface diagram is given to understand the connection between the two different regions of spacetime. The validity regions of all the energy conditions are calculated. A detailed graphical analysis is provided for validity regions of all the energy conditions. The presence of exotic matter is confirmed in both the cases as the null energy condition is violated.
