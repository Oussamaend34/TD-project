Magnesium-doped ZnO nanoparticles (Mg0.1Zn0.9O) were successfully synthesized following the solution combustion method. The effect of magnesium on the morphology, crystalline phases, and optical properties of the ZnO nanoparticles was studied. A relative band gap enhancement has been observed using the density functional theory (DFT) calculation through Mg doping from 3.19 eV to 3.24 eV. The photocatalytic degradation of 4-nitrophenol (4-NPh) has been investigated under UV irradiation in aqueous suspension where 1.5 g of Mg0.1Zn 0.9O/L removed 81% of 4-NPh (60 mg/L) under a pH solution of 12 within 120 min.
