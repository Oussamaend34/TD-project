AbstractSoil-Vegetation-Atmosphere Transfer Models (SVAT) and Crop Simulation Models describe physical and physiological processes occurring in crop canopies. Remote sensing data may be used through assimilation procedures for constraining or driving SVAT and crop models. These models provide continuous simulation of processes such as evapotranspiration and, thus, direct means for interpolating evapotranspiration between remote sensing data acquisitions (which is not the case for classical evapotranspiration mapping methods). They also give access to variables other than evapotranspiration, such as soil moisture and crop production. We developed the coupling between crop, SVAT and radiative transfer models in order to implement assimilation procedures in various wavelength domains (solar, thermal and microwave). Such coupling makes it possible to transfer information from one model to another and then to use remote sensing information for retrieving model parameters which are not directly related to remote sensing data (such as soil initial water content, plant growth parameters, physical properties of soil and so on). Simple assimilation tests are presented to illustrate the main techniques that may be used for monitoring crop processes and evapotranspiration. An application to a small agricultural area is also performed showing the potential of such techniques for retrieving evapotranspiration and information on irrigation practices over wheat fields.
