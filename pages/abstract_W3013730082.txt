Environmental and occupational exposures to copper (Cu) play a pivotal role in the etiology of some neurological diseases and reduced cognitive functions. However, the precise mechanisms of its effects on cognitive function have not been yet thoroughly established. In our study, we aimed to investigate the behavior and neurochemical alterations in hippocampus of male and female rats, chronically exposed to copper chloride (CuCl2) and the possible involvement of oxidative stress. Twenty-four rats, for each gender, were divided into control and three test groups (n = 6), and were injected intraperitoneally with saline (0.9% NaCl) or CuCl2 (0.25 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg) for 8 weeks. After the treatment period, Y-maze test was used for the evaluation of spatial working memory and the Morris Water Maze (MWM) to test the spatial learning and memory. Biochemical determination of oxidative stress levels in hippocampus was performed. The main results of the present work are working memory impairment in spatial Y-maze which induced by higher Cu intake (1 mg/kg) in male and female rats. Also, In the MWM test, the spatial learning and memory were significantly impaired in rats treated with Cu at dose of 1 mg/kg. Additionally, markers of oxidative stress such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, lipid peroxidation products and nitric oxide levels were significantly altered following Cu treatments. These data propose that compromised behavior following Cu exposure is associated with increase in oxidative stress.
