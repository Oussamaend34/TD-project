Summary The NALCN channelosome is vital in mammals: homozygous mutant mice exhibit neonatal lethal phenotype and NALCN plays a crucial role in neuronal excitability. NALCN is involved in the regulation of resting membrane potential and is modulated by hormones and neurotransmitters. In the present article, we provide an extensive review of the literature describing the molecular and functional properties of the NALCN channelosome, the various phenotypes observed in NALCN animal models, as well as the recent implications of NALCN in human diseases. We also discuss how NALCN could represent a therapeutic target to treat a wide variety of human diseases, especially neurological and psychiatric diseases. Unfortunately, the lack of specific pharmacology is clearly a brake to all the NALCN investigations. In the coming years, the expected development of selective agonists/antagonists, as well as new animal models, should foster our understanding of the functional properties and physiological roles of the NALCN channelosome.
