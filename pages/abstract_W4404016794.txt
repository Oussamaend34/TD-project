This study aims to assess groundwater quality and the human health risks associated with nitrate contamination using a human health risk assessment model. 45 groundwater samples were collected in 2016 and 2023 in the Angads aquifer. According to the findings, the groundwater was brackish (TDS > 1000 mg/L), extremely hard (TH > 450 mg/L CaCO3), and contained ions in the sequence Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+ > NH4+ for cations, and Cl− > HCO3− > SO42− > NO3− for anions. The TH-TDS graph and the groundwater quality index (GWQI) show that the majority of samples are unfit for consumption. Based on NO3− concentrations most often observed in the south of the research area, where many activities are likely to be sources of nitrates, the human health risk assessment reveals high non-carcinogenic risks for people living in the region, particularly for infants (71.1% on 2016 and 93.3% on 2023). Consumption of groundwater contaminated with nitrates over a long period could present a potential risk to human health.
