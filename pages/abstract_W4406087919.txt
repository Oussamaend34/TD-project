This study presents the fabrication and characterization of mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) incorporating green-synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using Hibiscus Rosa sinensis extract within a polyethersulfone (PES) matrix for nanofiltration (NF) application. The membranes were evaluated for their pure water permeability, salt rejection, dye removal, and antifouling performance. Results showed that the membrane with 0.75 wt% AgNPs exhibited the highest pure water permeability of 36L/m2 h−1 bar−1 attributed to increased porosity and enhanced hydrophilicity. Addition of 0.75wt% AgNPs resulted in significant improvements, with NaCl rejection increased from 32 to 57%, MgSO4 from 26 to 67%, and CaCl2 from 27 to 41%. Antifouling tests revealed that the 0.75 wt% AgNPs membrane had the lowest irreversible fouling and highest flux recovery due to the antimicrobial action and improved surface properties of AgNPs. Importantly, the performance of the fabricated membranes align with loose nanofiltation characteristcs, as evidence by high dye rejection rates coupled with moderate rejection of salts. This study highlights the potential of green-synthesized AgNPs as effective nanofillers for developing high-performance and environmentally sustainable membranes into wastewater treatment.
