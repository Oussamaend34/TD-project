Abstract: The onset of convection in a horizontal nanofluid layer of finite depth is a subject that can never be over-emphasized as it plays a significant role in controlling the transport phenomenon within a nanofluidic medium. This body of knowledge led to a doubtful report in 2014 by Nield and Kuznetsov concerning some obtained equations and established results. However, the accuracy of the thermal stability characteristics is strongly dependent on the used model as well as the employed methodological procedure. In this report, countable models are suggested as a better improvement of the aforementioned analysis. Either mathematical or technical point of view, it is worth concluding that the approximate analytical results elaborated by Nield and Kuznetsov can be improved properly by using the models presented herein.
