Selective laser melting has become among the most popular laser powder bed fusion processes in additive manufacturing technologies in the past decades, thanks to the variety of printed materials available in the market, and to the mechanical and physical properties outcomes. Nevertheless, a special consideration should be given to the surface quality which not only influences the mechanical, dynamic behavior but also the electrochemical resistance of the as-built non-finished selective laser melted parts. Therefore, this work is fully dedicated to the understanding of the as-built surface texture according to four process parameters, namely building-orientation (Oth), laser power (P), scan speed (V), and hatch spacing (h); 3D topography and 2D profiles were captured resulting in substantial surface sampling for the statistical analysis; further optical microscopy followed trying to draw the interplay between the balls formation and the standardized roughness indices. The arithmetic mean roughness (Ra) ranged between 7.55 and 37.8 µm, while the best surface quality was reached for top face of the horizontal samples, power at 200 W, scan speed at 1500 mm/s, and the lowest hatch spacing of 100 µm. Moreover, it was found that the Rp statistics seems to be more adapted to the analysis of the roughness of the as-built surfaces compared to the other roughness indices. The ANOVA findings revealed that the building and faces’ orientations can be assumed as the most significant for all responses, while laser power, scan speeds, and hatch space are found to highly influence the balls dimensions. The balls’ dimensions also contribute to the smoothness or roughness of the as-built samples drawing thus an indirect relationship between P, V, and h on the roughness level.
