Pharmaceuticals and personal care products present potential risks to human health and the environment. In particular, wastewater treatment plants often detect emerging pollutants that disrupt biological treatment. The activated sludge process is a traditional biological method with a lower capital cost and limited operating requirements than more advanced treatment methods. In addition, the membrane bioreactor combines a membrane module and a bioreactor, widely used as an advanced method for treating pharmaceutical wastewater with good pollution performance. Indeed, the fouling of the membrane remains a major problem in this process. In addition, anaerobic membrane bioreactors can treat complex pharmaceutical waste while recovering energy and producing nutrient-rich wastewater for irrigation. Wastewater characterizations have shown that wastewater’s high organic matter content facilitates the selection of low-cost, low-nutrient, low-surface-area, and effective anaerobic methods for drug degradation and reduces pollution. However, to improve the biological treatment, researchers have turned to hybrid processes in which all physical, chemical, and biological treatment methods are integrated to remove various emerging contaminants effectively. Hybrid systems can generate bioenergy, which helps reduce the operating costs of the pharmaceutical waste treatment system. To find the most effective treatment technique for our research, this work lists the different biological treatment techniques cited in the literature, such as activated sludge, membrane bioreactor, anaerobic treatment, and hybrid treatment, combining physicochemical and biological techniques.
