Structural, magnetic, electronic, elastic, thermodynamic, optical, and thermoelectric properties of full-Heusler alloys Co2YSn (Y = Ti; Zr; Hf) were determined using density functional theory-based WIEN2k code within GGA and GGA + U approximations for exchange correlation functions. The calculated formation energies and elastic parameters demonstrate the stability of these alloys. It was also observed that the studied compounds have a ductile structure and exhibit anisotropic behavior. The magnetic moment of these systems is equal to 2 μB, which conforms to the Slater–Pauling rule. In addition, the half-metallic ferrimagnetic behavior and good bandgap in the minority spin are showed for all compounds. The optical properties are systematically studied by computing the optical parameters. The existence of bandgaps with minimal energy loss in IR and visible regions makes these materials suitable candidates for optoelectronic devices. The thermoelectric properties of these systems were also examined in terms of temperature and chemical potential.
