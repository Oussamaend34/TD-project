Abstract It is commonly established that warm blooded animals are extremely vulnerable to the infectious coccidian parasite, Toxoplasma gondii. T. gondii can be transmitted to poultry and livestock through the ingestion of oocyst (fecal-oral), and placenta (congenital toxoplasmosis) in livestock. Cattle, sheep, and rabbits are some of the most consumed livestock in Palestine. As for poultry, backyard chicken, caged chicken, and caged turkeys are some of the most consumed birds. The aim of the present study is to detect the seroprevalence of Anti-T. gondii antibodies (IgG/IgM) among the frequently consumed livestock and poultry, which is collected from farms and slaughterhouses in Gaza, Palestine. For this specific study, blood samples from 213 cattle, 100 sheep, and 99 rabbits were collected. On the other hand, 50 blood samples from each type of poultry mentioned above were also collected. The criteria of samples collection based on a quick survey was performed among animal breeders and slaughterhouses owners in the study area, under the guidance of the colleagues in the Palestinian Ministry of Agriculture (veterinary department), as well as with the support of documented references as the targeted animal groups are the most suitable for meat production regardless of age and gender. The collected samples were analyzed through the use of the ELISA technique and Rapid Cassette Test. The results of the present study showed a high seroprevalence of Anti-T. gondii antibodies among sheep, which was 64.00 % and 13.14% among cattle. On the other hand, the results among backyard chicken and caged chicken were 26.00% and 2.00%, respectively. However, no antibodies were detected in the serum of rabbits and caged turkeys.DOI:https://doi.org/10.33976/IUGNS.30.1/2022/3
