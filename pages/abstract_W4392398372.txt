Abstract The continued reliance on carbon-based materials derived from fossil fuels exacerbates environmental challenges, demanding alternative cleaner energy sources. Within the realm of thermo-energy processes, graphitization holds a pivotal role in generating graphite structures featuring unparalleled conductivity, strength, and heat resistance. Nonetheless, traditional graphitization processes hinge on ultra-high temperatures surpassing 3000 °C, which poses significant challenges in terms of energy efficiency, environmental sustainability, and scalability. Catalytic graphitization emerges as a transformative solution, enabling the reduction of both temperature requirements and carbon emissions. Harnessing catalysts derived from diverse sources ensures the efficient transformation of amorphous carbon into crystalline graphite. Interestingly, biomass shines as a promising and renewable feedstock for graphitization due to its accessibility, and cost-effectiveness. It is noteworthy that catalysts play a dual role in lowering graphitization temperatures and enhancing carbon rearrangement when integrated into biomass-derived materials. The generated bio-graphite from catalytic processing of biomass finds multifaceted applications in energy storage, batteries, supercapacitors, and fuel cells, driven by its unique structure and exceptional conductivity. However, the diverse nature of raw materials and processing conditions employed in various studies poses challenges to the standardization of the process. This literature analysis seeks to bridge the gap by exploring the potential of biomass-based materials as feedstock for catalytic graphitization, paving the way for sustainable and efficient energetic applications in the ever-evolving energy landscape.
