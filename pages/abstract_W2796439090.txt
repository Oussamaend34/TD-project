Virtual screening emerged as an important tool in our quest to access successful CNS medicaments for treating Alzheimer's disease. The computational techniques applied in this screening are central nervous system multiparameter optimization (CNS MPO), golden triangle rule, structure activity/property relationships (SAR/SPR), Drug-likeness properties, and lipophilicity indices. These techniques offer the ability to guide drug design and selection to a quickly identify the compounds from a class of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors being pyridazine derivatives, with desirable drug-like attributes.
