New microsatellites markers [simple sequence repeat (SSR)] have been isolated from rose and integrated into an existing amplified fragment-length polymorphism genetic map. This new map was used to identify quantitative trait locus (QTL) controlling date of flowering and number of petals. From a rose bud expressed sequence tag (EST) database of 2,556 unigenes and a rose genomic library, 44 EST-SSRs and 20 genomic-SSR markers were developed, respectively. These new rose SSRs were used to expand genetic maps of the rose interspecific F1 progeny. In addition, SSRs from other Rosaceae genera were also tested in the mapping progeny. Genetic maps for the two parents of the progeny were constructed using pseudo-testcross mapping strategy. The maps consist of seven linkage groups of 105 markers covering 432 cM for the maternal map and 136 markers covering 438 cM for the paternal map. Homologous relationships among linkage groups between the maternal and paternal maps were established using SSR markers. Loci controlling flowering traits were localised on genetic maps as a major gene and QTL for the number of petals and a QTL for the blooming date. New SSR markers developed in this study will provide tools for the establishment of a consensus linkage map for roses that combine traits and markers in various rose genetic maps.
