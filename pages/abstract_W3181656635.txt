Groundwater is a primary natural water source in the absence of surface water bodies. Groundwater in urban environments experiences unprecedented stress from urban growth, population increase, and industrial activities. This study assessed groundwater quality in terms of arsenic and heavy metal contamination in three industrial areas (Shahdara, Jhilmil, and Patparganj), Delhi, India. The water quality was assessed over a 3-year time interval (i.e., 2015 and 2018). The groundwater constituents investigated were As, Fe, Cr, Cd, Ni, Zn, Mn, Cu, and Pb. Metal index and heavy metal pollution indexes were estimated to assess groundwater pollution. The health risk was evaluated in terms of non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risk assessment. Patparganj industrial area saw increment in concentration for Cu 0.23 mg/L (2015)–0.85 mg/L (2018), Zn 0.51 mg/L (2015)–7.2 mg/L (2018), Fe 0.32 mg/L (2015)–0.9 mg/L (2018), Cr 0.21 mg/L (2015)–0.26 mg/L (2018), Mn 0.14 mg/L (2015)–0.25 mg/L (2018), Ni 0.04 mg/L (2015)–0.34 mg/L (2018), and As 0.01 mg/L (2015)–0.18 mg/L (2018). Cd and Pb concentrations were observed to decrease by 40–90 % and 85–99% for all the three industrial areas. Metal index and heavy metal index values were found to be >1 for all locations. The risk quotient value > 1 was observed for all locations in the year 2015 but was found to increase further to a range of RQ 10–62 in the year 2018, inferring increased non-carcinogenic risk to consumers. The carcinogenic risk was significant with respect to Fe (0.2–0.7), Zn (0.001–0.007), and As (0.002–0.003) for all locations in the year 2015. This study concludes that groundwater in the three industrial areas is highly polluted and is not fit for human consumption. Further studies are required to explore possible control measures and develop methods to mitigate groundwater pollution, sustainable management, and optimized use to conserve it for future generations.
