Adsorption is a major basic and applied phenomenon in many scientific disciplines. In particular, the design of adsorbents to remove pollutants from wastewater requires advanced knowledge of adsorption isotherms, which are useful tools to identify physicochemical factors that control adsorption performance. Recent modeling of adsorption isotherms has focused on the use of statistical physics. Here, we review the major adsorption isotherm models based on statistical physics. We discuss steric, energetic, and thermodynamic parameters.
