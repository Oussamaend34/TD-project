The main focus of this paper is to explore the possibility of providing a new family of exact solutions for suitable anisotropic spherically symmetric systems in the realm of general relativity involving the embedding spherically symmetric static metric into the five-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean space. In this regard, we ansatz a new metric potential $$\lambda (r)$$ λ ( r ) , and we obtained the other metric potential $$\nu (r)$$ ν ( r ) by mains of embedding class one approach. The unknown constants are determined by the matching of interior space-time with the Schwarzschild exterior space-time. The physical acceptability of the generating celestial model for anisotropic compact stars is approved via acting several physical tests of the main salient features viz., energy density, radial and tangential pressures, anisotropy effect, dynamical equilibrium, energy conditions, and dynamical stability, which are well-compared with experimental statistics of four different compact stars: PSR J1416-2230, PSR J1903+327, 4U 1820-30 and Cen X-3. Conclusively, all the compact stars under observations are realistic, stable, and are free from any physical or geometrical singularities. We find that the embedding class one solution for anisotropic compact stars is viable and stable, plus, it provides circumstantial evidence in favor of super-massive pulsars.
