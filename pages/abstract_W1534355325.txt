Transgenic plums containing the plum pox potyvirus coat protein (PPV-CP) gene were inoculated with PPV. Infection was monitored by evaluating symptoms, ELISA, and IC-RT-PCR. Transgenic clone C5 was highly resistant to PPV during four years of testing and displayed characteristics typical of post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS), including a high level of transgene transcription in the nucleus, low levels of transgene mRNA in the cytoplasm, a complex multicopy transgene insertion with aberrant copies, and methylation of the silenced PPV-CP transgene. The PPV-CP transgene was also methylated in seedlings of C5 and these seedlings were resistant to PPV. Our results show, for the first time, that PTGS functions as a mechanism for virus resistance in a woody perennial species.
