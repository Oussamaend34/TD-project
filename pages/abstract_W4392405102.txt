This paper proposes a novel data communication model for the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) powered smart healthcare applications based on blockchain and cryptography. The proposed model enhances the data communication security of IoMT applications through the distributed ledger technology of blockchain and encryption algorithms of cryptography. The model is designed to provide a secure and reliable channel for data transmission and storage between IoMT nodes and healthcare stakeholders. Moreover, the model is capable of detecting data manipulation and unauthorized access attempts. In addition, the messaging protocol of the proposed model is capable of reducing the communication overhead of the IoMT network. Finally, the proposed model is tested using a scenario of smart healthcare applications for the elderly, and the results show the effectiveness and reliability of the model for IoMT-powered smart healthcare applications.
