An angular analysis of the decay B d 0 → K∗μ+μ− is presented, based on proton-proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. The study is using 20.3 fb−1 of integrated luminosity collected during 2012 at centre-of-mass energy of s = 8 $$ \sqrt{s}=8 $$ TeV. Measurements of the K* longitudinal polarisation fraction and a set of angular parameters obtained for this decay are presented. The results are compatible with the Standard Model predictions.
