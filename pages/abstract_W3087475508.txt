The present article addresses the concept of p-convex functions on fractal sets. We are able to prove a novel auxiliary result. In the application aspect, the fidelity of the local fractional is used to establish the generalization of Simpson-type inequalities for the class of functions whose local fractional derivatives in absolute values at certain powers are p-convex. The method we present is an alternative in showing the classical variants associated with generalized p-convex functions. Some parts of our results cover the classical convex functions and classical harmonically convex functions. Some novel applications in random variables, cumulative distribution functions and generalized bivariate means are obtained to ensure the correctness of the present results. The present approach is efficient, reliable, and it can be used as an alternative to establishing new solutions for different types of fractals in computer graphics.
