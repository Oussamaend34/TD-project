It is our interest to screen Oela europaea L and Ficus carica L leaf extract for total phenolic, flavonoid contents and to evaluate their free radical scavenging and Ferric reducing power (FRAP) using 1,1–diphenyl–2–picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). Data shows that Olea europaea and Ficus carica have strong antioxidant potency to scavenge free radical at an optimal phenolic and flavonoid concentration. Results further suggest a strong correlation between antioxidant activities, phenolic and flavonoid contents. Thus, the screening of Ficus carica and Olea europaea leaf extracts for potential antioxidants as source of drugs for several diseases especially oxidative stress and cancers is illustrated.
