This paper is devoted to studying the finite-time and fixed-time of inertial Cohen–Grossberg type neural networks (ICGNNs) with time varying delays. First, by constructing a proper variable substitution, the original (ICGNNs) can be rewritten as first-order differential system. Second, by utilizing feedback controllers and constructing suitable Lyapunov functionals, several new sufficient conditions guaranteeing the finite-time and the fixed-time synchronization of ICGNNs with time varying delays are obtained based on different finite-time synchronization analysis techniques. The obtained sufficient conditions are simple and easy to verify. Numerical simulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.
