An elongation of the single-valued neutrosophic set is an interval-valued neutrosophic set. It has been demonstrated to deal indeterminacy in a decision-making problem. Real-world problems have some kind of uncertainty in nature and among them; one of the influential problems is solving the shortest path problem (SPP) in interconnections. In this contribution, we consider SPP through Bellman’s algorithm for a network using interval-valued neutrosophic numbers (IVNNs). We proposed a novel algorithm to obtain the neutrosophic shortest path between each pair of nodes. Length of all the edges is accredited an IVNN. Moreover, for the validation of the proposed algorithm, a numerical example has been offered. Also, a comparative analysis has been done with the existing methods which exhibit the advantages of the new algorithm.
