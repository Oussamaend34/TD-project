Beef and dairy products suffer from a negative health image, related to the nature of their lipid fraction. Rumen lipid metabolism involves the presence of saturated lipids in ruminant tissues. Lipolysis, fatty acid biohydrogenation and formation of microbial fatty acids in the rumen and their effects on rumen outflow of fatty acids are discussed. Special emphasis is given to the formation of trans-fatty acids and the possibilities of decreasing biohydrogenation. Small differences in intestinal digestibilities of fatty acids are mentioned, followed by a discussion on transfer of absorbed fatty acids into milk and adipose tissue lipids. The preferential retention of polyunsaturated fatty acids as well as the balance between synthesis and incorporation of fatty acids in tissues is described. Dietary means for the modification of milk fat are listed, with special emphasis on the possibilities for enrichment in polyunsaturated fatty acids and the presence of conjugated linoleic acids. A description of the nature and development of fat depots in beef cattle is followed by a discussion of breed, conformation and feed effects on adipose tissue distribution and fatty acid composition. Special emphasis is given to the very lean Belgian Blue double-muscled breed. The review ends with a consideration of the limits to the modification of ruminant fats, involving considerations of consumer acceptance as well as animal welfare and environmental effects.
