AbstractThe RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 is one of the optimum targets for antiviral drug design and development. The hydroxyl groups of cytidine structures were modified with different aliphatic and aromatic groups to obtain 5´-O-acyl and 2´,3´-di-O-acyl derivatives, and then, these derivatives were employed in molecular modeling, antiviral prediction, molecular docking, molecular dynamics, pharmacological and POM studies. Density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G++ level analyzed biochemical behavior and molecular electrostatic potential (MESP) of the modified cytidine derivatives. The antiviral parameters of the mutated derivatives revealed promising drug properties compared with those of standard antiviral drugs. Molecular docking has determined binding affinities and interactions between the cytidine derivatives and SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. The modified derivatives strongly interacted with prime Pro620 and Lys621 residues. The binding conformation and interactions stability were investigated by 200 ns of molecular dynamics simulations and predicted the compounds to firmly dock inside the RdRp binding pocket. Interestingly, the binding residues of the derivatives were revealed in high equilibrium showing an enhanced binding affinity for the molecules. Intermolecular interactions are dominated by both Van der Waals and electrostatic energies. Finally, the pharmacokinetic characterization of the optimized inhibitors confirmed the safety of derivatives due to their improved kinetic properties. The selected cytidine derivatives can be suggested as potential inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2. The POM Theory supports the hypothesis above by confirming the existence of an antiviral (Oδ-—O’δ-) pharmacophore site of Hits.
