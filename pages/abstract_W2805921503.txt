The inhibitory behaviour of non-ionic sugar based N,N′-didodecyl-N,N′-digluconamideethylenediamine gemini surfactant, designated as Glu(12)-2-Glu(12) on mild steel (MS) corrosion in 3.5% NaCl at 30–60 °C was explored using weight loss, PDP, EIS and SEM/EDAX/AFM techniques. The compound inhibited the corrosion of mild steel in 3.5% NaCl and the extent of inhibition was dependent on concentration and temperature. The inhibiting action of Glu(12)-2-Glu(12) is synergistically enhanced on addition of potassium iodide (KI) at all concentrations and temperatures. The inhibiting formulation comprising of 2.5 × 10−3 mM of Glu(12)-2-Glu(12) and 10 mM of KI exhibits an inhibition efficiency of 96.9% at 60 °C. Quantum chemical calculations and MD simulation were applied to analyze the experimental data and elucidate the adsorption behaviour and inhibition mechanism of inhibitors. MD simulation showed a nearly parallel or flat disposition for Glu(12)-2-Glu(12) molecules on the MS surface providing larger blocking area to prevent the metal surface from corrosion.
