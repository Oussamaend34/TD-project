Rapeseed plants have been regenerated after fusion between protoplasts bearing cytoplasms of different genera. Cybrids combine, in a first experiment Brassica napus chloroplasts and a cytoplasmic male sterility (cms) trait coming from Raphanus sativus, in a second experiment chloroplasts of a triazine resistant Brassica campestris and cms trait from Raphanus sativus. Transfer of chloroplasts has been confirmed by restriction cp DNA analysis and two dimensional thylakoïd protein electrophoresis. These plants may be very useful for Brassica hybrid seed production.
