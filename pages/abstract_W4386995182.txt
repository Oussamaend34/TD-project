Abstract The objective of this study is to create a nonlinear control system designed for a Vienna converter-connected five-phase aerogenerator. The control strategy will be based on the space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) technique, which is more suitable for controlling rectifier switches. Due to the higher complexity of the five-phase permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) machine than the conventional three-phase generator, it poses a difficult control problem requiring an advanced mathematical model. Integrating an aerogenera tor with a Vienna converter enhances efficiency and power quality. The primary purpose of this study is to develop a nonlinear controller utilizing the retrogres sion control strategy alongside the SVPWM approach. Furthermore, a speed optimizer based on an artificial neural network is implemented to improve the system’s overall efficiency and meet multiple objectives. The proposed control system improves the overall operation and efficiency of Vienna’s integrated wind turbine and rectifier system
