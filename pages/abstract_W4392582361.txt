The maximum power point tracker (MPPT) is essential for optimizing the performance of PV systems, especially off-grid systems in remote areas. Although incremental conductance (InC) is the most commonly used of MPPT strategies, it has drawbacks, including trade-off between fluctuation and convergence speed, as well as the occurrence of drift phenomenon. To address these issues, this paper proposes an enhanced InC MPPT strategy. The latter utilizes a new adaptive step magnitude based on an absolute value of the variation in power, voltage, and current of the PV array to automatically adjust the perturbation step with respect to the weather variation circumstances. In addition, it includes a drift avoidance mechanism to further increase the robustness of the tracking. To investigate the performance of the amended InC MPPT strategy, it is integrated into an off-grid PV system, which feeds batteries as loads. First, it is examined by simulation using MATLAB/Simulink software under sudden and ramp changes in solar intensity and ambient temperature. Then it is performed using an experimental test bench using a dSPACE DS1104 card. The results obtained during simulation and practical investigations verify the highest effectiveness of the amended InC strategy compared to the original one in terms of tracking precision, fluctuation, converging velocity, power loss, and tracking efficiency. Additionally, it shows robust and superior performance compared to recently proposed MPPT techniques, with the lowest tracking time (less than 0.012 s) and the highest average tracking efficiency (99.84%), leading to effective optimization of PV energy.
