This volume presents an exhaustive overview of major orebodies and mineral deposits of North Africa. It is intended both for academic researchers and especially for exploration geologists interested in mineral exploration in the northern part of the African continent. Recent changes in the mining laws of most countries in this region have encouraged international mining companies to invest in local mineral industries. Accordingly, this volume will be very useful for these professionals, as well as for researchers in the field of economic geology.
