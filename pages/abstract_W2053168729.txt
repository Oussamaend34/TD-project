In order to select Actinobacteria that could improve plant growth and thus agricultural yield, we assessed different plant growth promoting (PGP) abilities of eight rock phosphate (RP)-solubilizing Actinomycete isolates originating from Moroccan phosphate mines. Six of these strains were able to grow on root exudates of the wheat plant as sole nutrient sources and were efficiently releasing soluble phosphate from RP. These strains also inhibited the growth of potentially phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria (Gram +/−) or yeasts. Five of these strains produced indoleacetic acid and four showed endophytic properties. When these strains were grown, in the presence of the wheat plant, in a synthetic minimum medium (SMM) containing insoluble RP as unique phosphate source or in soil experiment, the most active RP-solubilizing strains had the highest stimulatory effect on the production of plant biomass. The most efficient strain Streptomyces griseus-related strain (BH7), stimulated aerial growth of the plant more than 70% in test tubes and more than 30% in RP soil compared to the non-inoculated control treatment. This study demonstrated that our selected Actinomycete strains could be used for the development of novel, non-polluting; farming practices by entering in the formulation of novel biofertilizer and biocontrol products constituted by spores and/or mycelium of the ad hoc Actinobacteria in association with pulverized RP.
