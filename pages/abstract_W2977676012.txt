AbstractFractional differential equations with delay behaviors occur in fields like physical and biological ones with state-dependent delay or nonconstant delay and has drawn the attention of researchers. The main goal of the present work is to study the existence of mild solutions of neutral differential system along state-dependent delay in Banach space. By employing the fractional theory, noncompact measure and Mönch’s theorem, we investigate the existence results for neutral differential equations of fractional order with state-dependent delay. An illustration of derived results is offered.Keywords: Mönch fixed point theorem; neutral equations; noncompact measure; state-dependent delayMSC 2010: 47H08; 47H10; 34K37
