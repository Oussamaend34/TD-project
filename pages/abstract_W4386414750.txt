The supply-demand-based optimization (SDO) is among the recent stochastic approaches that have proven its capability in solving challenging engineering tasks. Owing to the non-linearity and complexity of the real-world IEEE optimal power flow (OPF) in modern power system issues and like the existing algorithms, the SDO optimizer necessitates some enhancement to satisfy the required OPF characteristics integrating hybrid wind and solar powers. Thus, a SDO variant namely leader supply-demand-based optimization (LSDO) is proposed in this research. The LSDO is suggested to improve the exploration based on the simultaneous crossover and mutation mechanisms and thereby reduce the probability of trapping in local optima. The LSDO effectiveness has been first tested on 23 benchmark functions and has been assessed through a comparison with well-regarded state-of-the-art competitors. Afterward, Three well-known constrained IEEE 30, 57, and 118-bus test systems incorporating both wind and solar power sources were investigated in order to authenticate the performance of the LSDO considering a constraint handling technique called superiority of feasible solutions (SF). The statistical outcomes reveal that the LSDO offers promising competitive results not only for its first version but also for the other competitors.
