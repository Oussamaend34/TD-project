Despite markedly different structures, both class I and class II viral membrane-fusion proteins adopt a hairpin conformation, inducing fusion of viral and cellular membranes. This review focuses on the class II proteins, using Semliki Forest virus and tick-borne encephalitis virus fusion proteins as examples. Structure–function studies have defined two classes of viral membrane-fusion proteins that have radically different architectures but adopt a similar overall 'hairpin' conformation to induce fusion of the viral and cellular membranes and therefore initiate infection. In both classes, the hairpin conformation is achieved after a conformational change is triggered by interaction with the target cell. This review will focus in particular on the properties of the more recently described class II proteins.
