Abstract Unit commitment (UC) is a popular problem in electric power system that aims at minimizing the total cost of power generation in a specific period, by defining an adequate scheduling of the generating units. The UC solution must respect many operational constraints. In the past half century, there was several researches treated the UC problem. Many works have proposed new formulations to the UC problem, others have offered several methodologies and techniques to solve the problem. This paper gives a literature review of UC problem, its mathematical formulation, methods for solving it and Different approaches developed for addressing renewable energy effects and uncertainties.
