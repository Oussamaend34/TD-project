We investigate the behavior of quantum correlations in two-coupled double quantum dots (DQDs) with two excess electrons by employing local quantum uncertainty (LQU) and local quantum Fisher information (LQFI) as reliable quantifiers of the amount of quantum correlations contained in the considered physical system. The variations of the quantum correlation measures LQU and LQFI are explored in terms of finite temperature, the weight of the Coulomb coupling between electrons and tunneling coupling between charge qubits. The results show that the Coulomb potential introduces and modulates the nonclassical correlations between both DQDs and that the amount of the quantifiers can be manipulated by changing the tunneling coupling between the two-coupled DQDs. We find that quantum correlations resist low thermal noise and keep a higher value at large values of the Coulomb potential and low temperatures. In addition, our findings confirm that LQFI reveals more nonclassical correlations than LQU in two-coupled DQDs system.
