To enhance its low wear resistance, a surface treatment of ion nitriding was performed for Ti–6Al–4V titanium alloy. Structural characteristics of specimens were revealed by optical and scanning electron microscopy, and tribological behavior was evaluated using ball-on-disk tribometer by application of two different charges 5 N and 10 N. Electrochemical methods of potentiodynamic polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were used to evaluate the effect of this thermochemical treatment on the corrosion resistance of the studied alloy. Results showed that microhardness of nitrided Ti–6Al–4V represents a value greater with four, five times than that of the untreated alloy. The coefficient of friction was also optimized for the two charges applied. SEM analysis of the worn surfaces indicates that the wear of treated Ti–6Al–4V stills just superficial. However, electrochemical tests show that corrosion resistance of titanium alloy deteriorates after plasma nitriding.
