Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) stimulate growth rate in a number of animal species and are likely to contribute to genetic variations of growth potential. The present study was designed to link levels of IGF-I and IGF-II mRNA and peptides with growth rate in divergently selected genotypes of chickens with high (HG) or low (LG) growth rates. Circulating IGF-I and -II and hepatic mRNA levels were measured under ad libitum feeding conditions from 1 to 12 weeks of age, and at 6 weeks of age under three different nutritional conditions (fed, fasted for 16 or 48 h, re-fed for 4 or 24 h after a 48-h fast). IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) were also measured. Circulating IGFs increased with age and were higher in HG chickens from 1 to 6 weeks. They decreased with fasting and only IGF-II was fully restored after 24 h of re-feeding, while IGF-I remained low. A significant decrease in steady state IGF-I mRNA levels was also observed with fasting. Across the nutritional study, hepatic IGF-I mRNAs were significantly higher in HG chickens. Variations of IGF-II mRNA levels with nutritional state or genotype exhibited a similar trend. IGFBP (28, 34 and 40 kDa) levels increased with age, while only faint differences were observed between genotypes. IGFBP-28 transiently increased with fasting and was inversely related to blood glucose and insulin levels, suggesting that it is equivalent to mammalian IGFBP-1. In HG chickens, IGFBP-28 and IGFBP-34 levels decreased markedly following re-feeding. Therefore, high and low growth rates were respectively associated with high and low IGF-I and -II levels, supporting the hypothesis of a stimulatory role for both IGFs during post-hatching growth of chickens.
