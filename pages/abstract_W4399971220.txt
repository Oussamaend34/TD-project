The photocatalytic performance of high entropy alloy (HEA) and its oxide form (high entropy oxide, HEO) have been evaluated in this study. The HEA, composed of Nb, Ta, Zr, Mo, and W powders, was synthesized through a mechanical alloying process for 120 h. This process was carried out under a high-purity Ar atmosphere to prevent oxidation. Subsequently, the HEA was converted into HEO via a mechano-thermal oxidation method 900 °C for 12 h. The photocatalytic activity of both oxidized and non-oxidized samples was systematically evaluated by degradation of methyl blue (MB) under UV irradiation. Electron dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to investigate the structural and chemical features of the alloys. Furthermore, BET surface area analysis and Zeta potential measurements were conducted to understand the alloys’ surface properties and stability in aqueous solutions. The results showed that the HEA has a remarkable photodegradation performance of around 58.77% which is two times higher than that observed with the HEO. Graphical abstract
