The present study proposed the relationship among private investment in information and communication technology (ICT), carbon emissions (CO2), renewable energy, political risk, and economic growth over the period of 1985–2020 in Morocco. The dynamic ARDL simulations (ARDL) model suggests that private partnership in ICT plays a significant role in abating CO2 emissions, the adaptation of renewable energy is a key contributor in CO2 degradation, while economic growth shows a positive and significant association with CO2 emissions, indicating that economic growth increases CO2 emissions. The study also analyzed political risk in the study region, which indicates that low political risk mitigates CO2 emissions in Morocco. The findings provide significant enlightenment to acknowledge the importance of private partnership in ICT for the purpose to decarbonize CO2 emissions, and adopting the use of renewable energy. The findings also suggest that a stable political system is inventible towards low-carbon development.
