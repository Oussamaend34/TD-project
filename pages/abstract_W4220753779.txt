Bell’s inequalities are described by the sums of correlations including non-commuting observables in each of two systems. Bell’s inequalities violation is possible since the accuracy of any joint measurement of mentioned observables would be limited by quantum uncertainty relations. In this work, we investigate the generating and robustness of two-qubit information resources including two-qubit Bell nonlocality, quantum entanglement, and entropic measurement uncertainty in a two neighboring spin-1/2 particles coupled via the Heisenberg XYZ interaction subjected to a transverse uniform magnetic field by applying Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya (DM) and Kaplan–Shekhtman–Entin–Wohlman–Aharony (KSEA) interactions under intrinsic decoherence. The influence of DM–KSEA interactions, external magnetic field, and intrinsic decoherence on the dynamics of quantum correlations in our mentioned model is analyzed. Interestingly, new dynamical features of Bell nonlocality, entanglement, and entropic uncertainty are obtained by regulating the initial state, system parameters, and decoherence. Therefore, our results provide a helpful understanding of such dynamics and might offer an insight into measurement estimating in open quantum systems.
