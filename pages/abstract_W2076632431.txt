Abstract (Original language) Résumé Aqueous foams are formed of air bubbles dispersed in a water phase. Despite the simplicity of these ingredients, the resulting foams can have an impressive range of material properties. In this review, an overview will be given on recent results obtained on the foaming properties of particles, self-assembled and aggregated structures. We will highlight how the presence of objects inside the foam can drastically modify the foam stability from unstable to ultrastable.
