The results of a search for new heavy $$W^\prime $$ W ′ bosons decaying to an electron or muon and a neutrino using proton–proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of $$\sqrt{s}~=~13$$ s = 13 TeV are presented. The dataset was collected in 2015 and 2016 by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 $$\text{ fb }^{-1}$$ fb - 1 . As no excess of events above the Standard Model prediction is observed, the results are used to set upper limits on the $$W^\prime $$ W ′ boson cross-section times branching ratio to an electron or muon and a neutrino as a function of the $$W^\prime $$ W ′ mass. Assuming a $$W^\prime $$ W ′ boson with the same couplings as the Standard Model W boson, $$W^\prime $$ W ′ masses below 5.1 TeV are excluded at the 95% confidence level.
