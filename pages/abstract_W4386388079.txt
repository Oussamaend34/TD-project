The remarkable electronic and optical properties of organic–inorganic halide perovskite materials has led to a significant increase in performance. In this study, we used the SCAPS-1D numerical modeling tool to describe the optimized performance of a perovskite solar cell device based on methylammonium tin iodide ( $${\text{MASnI}}_{3}$$ MASnI 3 ; MA = $${\text{CH}}_{3} {\text{NH}}_{3}$$ CH 3 NH 3 ) using graphene oxide (GO) as the hole transport layer. Herein, different parameters impacting the efficiency of the solar cell are analyzed, including the thickness for both the $${\text{MASnI}}_{3}$$ MASnI 3 active layer and the GO layer, the defect density at the GO/ $${\text{MASnI}}_{3}$$ MASnI 3 interface, the defects at the $${\text{MASnI}}_{3}$$ MASnI 3 /ETL interface, the series resistance $$R_{{\text{s}}}$$ R s and shunt resistance $$R_{{{\text{SH}}}}$$ R SH , and the operating temperature of the solar cell. The glass/FTO/ETL/ $${\text{MASnI}}_{3}$$ MASnI 3 /GO/Au structure was found to have optimal performance with an open-circuit voltage ( $$V_{{{\text{OC}}}}$$ V OC ) of 0.71 V, short-circuit current ( $$J_{{{\text{SC}}}}$$ J SC ) of 34.83 $$ {\text{mA}}\,\,{\text{cm}}^{ - 2}$$ mA cm - 2 , fill factor (FF) of 77.59%, and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.16%. The results show that by optimizing the device parameters, it is possible to experimentally obtain efficient lead-free perovskite solar cells.
