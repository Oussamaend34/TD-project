A new sensor based on carbon paste electrode modified with Poly(1,8-diaminonaphthalene) and bismuth film (Bi-Poly1,8-DAN/CPE) was prepared and characterized with cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The sensor was found to exhibit an electroactivity toward the sensing of lead using square wave voltammetry in acidic medium. Various operational parameters, such as concentration of Bi(III), square wave voltammetric parameters, deposition potential and deposition time were investigated. Under the optimized conditions, a linear range was achieved over concentration range from 0.5 μg L−1 to 50 μg L−1, with a detection limit of 0.3 μg L−1 offering a good repeatability and reproducibility. Finally, the Bi-Poly1,8-DAN/CPE was applied for the analysis of lead in water samples with satisfactory results.
