A study of the decays $$B^0_s \rightarrow \mu ^+\mu ^-$$ B s 0 → μ + μ - and $$B^0 \rightarrow \mu ^+\mu ^-$$ B 0 → μ + μ - has been performed using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 25 fb $$^{-1}$$ - 1 of 7 and 8 TeV proton–proton collisions collected with the ATLAS detector during the LHC Run 1. For the $$B^0$$ B 0 dimuon decay, an upper limit on the branching fraction is set at $$\mathcal{B}(B^0 \rightarrow \mu ^+\mu ^-) < 4.2 \times 10^{-10}$$ B ( B 0 → μ + μ - ) < 4.2 × 10 - 10 at 95 % confidence level. For $$B^0_s$$ B s 0 , the branching fraction $$\mathcal{B}(B^0_s \rightarrow \mu ^+\mu ^-) = \left( 0.9^{+1.1}_{-0.8} \right) \times 10^{-9}$$ B ( B s 0 → μ + μ - ) = 0 . 9 - 0.8 + 1.1 × 10 - 9 is measured. The results are consistent with the Standard Model expectation with a p value of 4.8 %, corresponding to 2.0 standard deviations.
