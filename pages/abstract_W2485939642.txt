A search for neutral Higgs bosons of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) and for a heavneutral $$Z^{\prime }$$ Z ′ boson is performed using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb $$^{-1}$$ - 1 from proton–proton collisions at $$\sqrt{s} = 13$$ s = 13 $${\mathrm {TeV}}$$ TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The heavy resonance is assumed to decay to a $$\tau ^+ \tau ^-$$ τ + τ - pair with at least one $$\tau $$ τ lepton decaying to final states with hadrons and a neutrino. The search is performed in the mass range of 0.2–1.2 $${\mathrm {TeV}}$$ TeV for the MSSM neutral Higgs bosons and 0.5–2.5 $${\mathrm {TeV}}$$ TeV for the heavy neutral $$Z^{\prime }$$ Z ′ boson. The data are in good agreement with the background predicted by the Standard Model. The results are interpreted in MSSM and $$Z^{\prime }$$ Z ′ benchmark scenarios. The most stringent constraints on the MSSM $$m_A$$ m A – $$\tan \beta $$ tan β space exclude at 95 % confidence level (CL) $$\tan \beta > 7.6$$ tan β > 7.6 for $$m_A = 200$$ m A = 200 $$\text {GeV}$$ GeV in the $$m_{h}^{\text {mod+}}$$ m h mod+ MSSM scenario. For the Sequential Standard Model, a $$Z^{\prime }_\mathrm {SSM}$$ Z SSM ′ mass up to 1.90 $${\mathrm {TeV}}$$ TeV is excluded at 95 % CL and masses up to 1.82–2.17 $${\mathrm {TeV}}$$ TeV are excluded for a $$Z^{\prime }_{\mathrm {SFM}}$$ Z SFM ′ of the strong flavour model.
