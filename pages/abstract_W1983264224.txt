Osmotic adjustment (OA) was previously demonstrated to be an important adaptive mechanism of drought tolerance in cereals. In order to determine which genomic regions are involved in OA variation, 187 barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between Tadmor (drought tolerant) and Er/Apm (susceptible) were studied in a growth chamber for their OA capacity (through correlated traits and by calculation), at an early growth stage and under two water treatments (soil moisture of 14% and 100% of field capacity). The continuous distribution of the traits and their broad-sense line heritabilities, ranging from 0.04 to 0.44, indicated that OA and related traits should have a polygenic nature. A subset of 167 RILs were also genotyped using 78 RFLP, 32 RAPD and three morphological markers and a linkage map was constructed. Despite strong environmental effects acting on the traits, interval mapping and single-marker ANOVA allowed the detection of three QTLs for relative water content (RWC), four QTLs for osmotic potential (ψπ), two QTLs of osmotic potential at full turgor (ψπ100) and one QTL for osmotic adjustment at a soil moisture of 14% field capacity. For the irrigated treatment, only two QTLs were detected: one for RWC and one for ψπ100. Two chromosomal regions were involved in several OA-related trait variations and could be considered as regions controlling OA; these were present on chromosome 1 (7H) and chromosome 6 (6H), whereas other regions were specific for one trait. No major QTL was found. However, the genomic region involved in OA-related traits on chromosome 1 (7H) in barley seemed to be conserved for OA variation among cereals. Epistatic effects, with or without additive effects, acted on the traits.
