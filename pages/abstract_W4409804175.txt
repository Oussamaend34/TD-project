Partial shading conditions (PSC) in photovoltaic (PV) systems degrade energy harvest by generating multi-peak power-voltage (P–V) curves, trapping conventional maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms at local maxima. This paper presents a Multi-Peak to Single-Peak Conversion (MSMPPT) framework that enables conventional algorithms like Perturb Observe (PO) and Incremental Conductance (INC) to reliably track the global maximum power point (GMPP) under PSC without structural modifications. The framework operates via two stages: dynamic estimation of optimal voltage boundaries to shrink the GMPP search space to under 10% of the original P–V range, and active voltage regulation to enforce operation within this zone, effectively transforming the multi-peak curve into a single-peak profile. The proposed MSMPP-PO and MSMPP-INC algorithms achieve 50% faster tracking (64 ms vs. 122 ms for PO) and near-perfect steady-state efficiency under static shading, reducing power losses below 2%. In dynamic shading scenarios with abrupt irradiance shifts, MSMPPT maintains robustness with less than 1.5W net loss, outperforming conventional methods that incur over 30W of power losses. By eliminating oscillations and hotspot risks through voltage regulation, the framework retains algorithmic simplicity while enhancing performance under complex shading scenarios. Validated across benchmark shading profiles, MSMPPT demonstrates fidelity without requiring additional hardware or complex optimizers. This innovation bridges the gap between conventional MPPT simplicity and partial shading resilience, offering a cost-effective, scalable solution to boost PV system reliability in shading environments.
