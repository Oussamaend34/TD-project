The increased environmental awareness and tighter regulatory standards have prompted various industries to seek appropriate wastewater treatment technologies, in particular, for colored wastewater. This review provides detailed information on dyes, their classification, the environmental impact of water pollution on the national (Morocco) and international scales. Recent studies about the adsorption treatment process for the removal of dyes from the aqueous solution with different adsorbents recognized as a sustainable solution in terms of minimization, recovery, and reuse were evaluated. It is also aimed to synthesize the current literature data concerning low-cost adsorbents by systematically highlighting both their characteristics and capacities. Moreover, the applicability of various kinetic adsorption and isothermal models to the removal of dyes by a wide range of adsorbents is reported in addition to information regarding continuous system adsorption.
