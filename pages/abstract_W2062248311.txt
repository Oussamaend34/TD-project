A Phanerochaete chrysosporium strain was isolated from Moroccan olive mill waste water (OMW) and its ability to degrade OMW in different culture conditions was investigated and compared to that of Pleurotus ostreatus. The results indicated that Ph. chrysosporium isolate is more efficient than Pl. ostreatus in decolorising and detoxifying OMW in the presence of added nutrients. Ph. chrysosporium is able to remove more than 50% of the colour and phenols from OMW within 6 days of incubation, whereas Pl. ostreatus needs more than 12 days to reach similar results in the same conditions. Many factors affecting the treatment of diluted OMW (20%) by Ph. chrysosporium were studied, including the effects of added nutrients, initial pH, temperature and inoculated biomass. Once the optimisation of 20% OMW biodegradation process had been set up, higher OMW concentrations (50%) were tested. The results show that the fungus is capable of reducing all parameters analysed (colour A395, phenol content and chemical oxygen demand) by at least 60%, after only 9 days of growth.
