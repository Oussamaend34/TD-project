Abstract Nanocrystalline Gd3+-doped Co–Mg ferrite nanoparticles with the chemical formula Co0.7Mg0.3Fe(2−x)GdxO4 (x = 0.02) were prepared by coprecipitation for the first time. The properties of the nanoparticles were investigated by X-ray diffraction, confirming a single-phase, highly crystalline cubic spinel structure in the space group Fdm and an average crystallite size of 54 nm. The Fourier-transform infrared spectrum showed two fundamental absorption bands in the wavenumber range of 437–748 cm−1 attributed to the stretching vibration of tetrahedral and octahedral sites in the spinel structure. Scanning electron microscopy analysis showed that the nanoparticles are different in shape and slightly agglomerated. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy demonstrated the purity of the nano-ferrite powder. Magnetic measurements revealed ferrimagnetic behavior at room and low temperatures with high coercivity and a high saturation magnetization of 95.68 emu g−1, larger than that of pure bulk cobalt ferrite (80.8 emu g−1). Only ferrite cobalt synthesized sonochemically has been reported to have a higher saturation magnetization (92.5 emu g−1).
