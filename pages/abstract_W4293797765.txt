Optoelectronic properties of the quaternary Heusler Ni2MnGa alloy were analyzed by using the full-potential linearized augmented-plane wave (FPLAPW), which is based on density functional theory. We will use the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and other methods. However, the study of electronic and magnetic properties indicated that the Ni2MnGa is a ferromagnetic material that has a semi-metallic characteristic with a Curie temperature approximately 358 K obtained by the GGA method and thus is considered a promising candidate for incorporation into spintronic devices. Also, the prediction of a more stable structure to this material is obtained by the uniaxial deformation of the basic structure in the austenite phase, producing a tetragonal structure in the martensitic phase at a transformation temperature equal to 132 K. Finally, the optical and thermoelectric properties of the Ni2MnGa alloy show a noticeable structural dependence for the weak values of the photon energies.
