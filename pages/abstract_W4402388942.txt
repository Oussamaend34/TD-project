The complement system is a set of over 50 proteins that constitutes an essential part of the innate immune system. Complement system activation involves an organized proteolytic cascade. Overactivation of complement system activation is the main pathogenic mechanism of several diseases and contributes to the manifestations of many other conditions. This review describes the normal complement system and the role for complement dysregulation in critical illnesses, notably sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Complement activation is involved in the immune system response to pathogens but, when excessive, can contribute to tissue damage, runaway inflammation, and capillary leakage syndrome. Complement overactivation may play a key role in severe forms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Two diseases whose manifestations are mainly caused by complement overactivation, namely, atypical hemolytic and uremic syndrome (aHUS) and myasthenia gravis, are discussed. A diagnostic algorithm for aHUS is provided. Early complement-inhibiting therapy has been proven effective. When renal transplantation is required, complement-inhibiting drugs can be used prophylactically to prevent aHUS recurrence. Similarly, acetylcholine-receptor autoantibody-positive generalized myasthenia gravis involves complement system overactivation and responds to complement inhibition. The two main complement inhibitors used in to date routine are eculizumab and ravulizumab. The main adverse event is Neisseria infection, which is rare and preventable, but can be fatal. The complement system is crucial to health but, when overactivated, can cause or contribute to disease. Effective complement inhibitors are now available, although additional data are required to determine optimal regimens. Further research is also needed to better understand the complement system, develop advanced diagnostic tools, and identify markers that allow the personalization of treatment strategies.
