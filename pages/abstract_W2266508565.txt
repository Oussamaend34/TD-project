Deep drawing is an important manufacturing process in industry. In order to obtain high-quality products produced by deep drawing, the set of design variables used in forming operation is designed through deterministic optimization. However, in real forming process, the design variables show variability and randomness which will affect the product quality. These uncertainties are an inherent characteristic of nature and cannot be avoided. This paper focuses on uncertainty analysis of deep drawing with the consideration of uncertainties in material parameters and friction. An uncertainty analysis approach which combines the finite element method (FEM) simulation, surrogate modeling, and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) is presented in this work. The constructed surrogate models are validated and compared by cross validation and error measures. Then Monte Carlos Simulation is conducted by the use of the constructed surrogate model. The surrogate model based probabilistic method used in this paper is an approach with high-efficiency and sufficient accuracy for uncertainty analysis in deep drawing.
