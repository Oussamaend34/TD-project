Several studies on solar cells using SCAPS-1D were conducted to investigate their performance, which are typically limited to I–V analysis for DC characterization. Therefore, in the present study, a very wide frequency range from 10–2 Hz to 1012 Hz was employed to explore diffusion processes and investigate the performance of lead-free Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs) featuring as a novel heterostructure. These investigations concern the optimization of MASnI3 thickness as an absorber. Additionally, the impact of series (Rs) and shunt (Rsh) resistances is also examined. From the I–V analysis, it was determined that the power efficiency (PCE) could be achieved at a thickness of 0.6 µm. Increasing the series resistance (Rs) led to a significant decrease in the fill factor (FF) and (PCE), whereas the shunt resistance (Rsh) demonstrated a notable improvement in both (FF) and (PCE). Analysis of AC characteristics revealed complex impedance (Z*) and modulus (M*) indicative of main ionic transport, recombination, and diffusion processes crucial for optimization. An appropriate equivalent circuit model was developed and validated through deconvolution and theoretical considerations, yielding parameters such as the time constant for each process. It was observed that ionic conductivity and electronic diffusion play key roles in balancing charge collection and recombination losses. The critical influence of series and shunt resistance on low and high-frequency processes was emphasized, underscoring their significance in solar cell efficiency. A strong correlation was established between the evolution of time constants for each process and power conversion efficiency (PCE).
