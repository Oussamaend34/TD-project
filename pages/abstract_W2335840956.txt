What is known about this topic Acinetobacter is a non-fermenting Gram negative coccobacillus with a high capacity to colonize the human body and the environmental reservoirs and it is associated with a high morbidity and a high mortality rate especially in immunocompromised patients. Acinetobacter is an opportunistic pathogen known for its intrinsic resistance to antibiotics and greater ability to rapidly acquire resistance genes. It generally has resistance to several antibiotics and MDR Acinetobacter baumannii is becoming a global threat with a therapeutic impasse increasingly described in literature. What this study adds This is the first study which shows the prevalence rate of infections and antibiotic resistance level in clinical isolates of Acinetobacter by comparing data from the intensive care units versus other units in our hospital and in our region. This study shows that the frequency and resistance of Acinetobacter isolates are increasing in our hospital. This is the first Moroccan study that reports the rate of MDR Acinetobacter . The infection Acinetobacter ’s prevalence and the MDR Acinetobacter rate were statically higher in the intensive care units compared to other units.
