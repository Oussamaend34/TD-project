This study employed numerical analysis to evaluate the sustainability of Serpentine Flow-Field and Straight channel PEM fuel cells, focusing on critical parameters such as reactant velocity, temperature, current density, water content, membrane hydration, and polarization behavior curve. The model incorporated the transportation of gases, water, and electrical current within the fuel cell's layers, emphasizing the importance of optimizing performance and reducing costs through the design of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA). Utilizing the finite element method and ANSYS Fluent, the model allowed for adjustments in parameters such as membrane thickness and protonic conductivity coefficient, both of which significantly impact cell performance. The findings indicated that both fuel cell designs performed well, with a slight advantage observed for the Straight channel configuration in terms of production. However, the performance difference was relatively small, with the Straight channel design outperforming the Serpentine Flow-Field configuration by approximately 5% in terms of production. Despite this slight discrepancy, both designs demonstrated good performance overall. Moreover, the study underscored the critical role of MEA design optimization in achieving maximum performance and cost-effectiveness. While Straight channel PEM fuel cells may be slightly more cost-effective for certain applications, Serpentine Flow-Field PEM fuel cells offer enhanced efficiency and durability, making them preferable in many scenarios. In conclusion, this research provides valuable insights into the sustainability of these two fuel cell designs, indicating that while both are viable options, Serpentine Flow-Field PEM fuel cells offer slightly better performance and durability, thus warranting consideration for future applications.
