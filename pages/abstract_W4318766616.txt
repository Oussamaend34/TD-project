Pseudomonas stutzeri phosphite dehydrogenase (PTDH) catalyzes the oxidation of phosphite to phosphate in the presence of NAD, resulting in the formation of NADH. The regeneration of NADH by PTDH is greater than any other enzyme due to the substantial change in the free energy of reaction (G°′ = − 63.3kJ/mol). Presently, improving the stability of PTDH is for a great importance to ensure an economically viable reaction process to produce phosphite as a byproduct for agronomic applications. The binding site of NAD+ with PTDH includes thirty-four residues; eight of which have been previously mutated and characterized for their roles in catalysis. In the present study, the unexplored twenty-six key residues involved in the binding of NAD+ were subjected to in silico mutagenesis based on the physicochemical properties of the amino acids. The effects of these mutations on the structure, stability, activity, and interaction of PTDH with NAD+ were investigated using molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, free energy calculations, and secondary structure analysis. We identified seven novel mutations, A155I, G157I, L217I, P235A, V262I, I293A, and I293L, that reduce the compactness of the protein while improving PTDH stability and binding to NAD+.
