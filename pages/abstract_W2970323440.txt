This paper presents an annual performance evaluation of three maximum power point tracking (MPPT) methods. The used MPPT techniques (Perturb and Observe, Incremental Inductance and Sliding mode) are evaluated under an annual data of atmospheric conditions of the target site. The main contribution of this work is to consider real fluctuation conditions of solar irradiations, ambient temperatures and wind velocities. It was found that the Sliding mode provides higher energy yields independently of the period. Compared to the basic P&O and the IC techniques, sliding mode has the potential of generating up to 8.18% more electrical energy than other techniques.
