Ensuring plant resilience to drought and phosphorus (P) stresses is crucial to support global food security. The phytobiome, shaped by selective pressures, harbors stress-adapted microorganisms that confer host benefits like enhanced growth and stress tolerance. Intercropping systems also offer benefits through facilitative interactions, improving plant growth in water- and P-deficient soils. Application of microbial consortia can boost the benefits of intercropping, although questions remain about the establishment, persistence, and legacy effects within resident soil microbiomes. Understanding microbe- and plant-microbe dynamics in drought-prone soils is key. This review highlights the beneficial effects of rhizobacterial consortia-based inoculants in legume-cereal intercropping systems, discusses challenges, proposes a roadmap for development of P-solubilizing drought-adapted consortia, and identifies research gaps in crop-microbe interactions. This review discusses the intricate interactions between rhizobacterial consortia-based inoculants, cropping systems, and soil abiotic stresses, focusing specifically on drought and phosphorous deficiency.
