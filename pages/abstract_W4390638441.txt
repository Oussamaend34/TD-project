In this review, copper ferrite (CuFe2O4) nanoparticles (NPs) have attracted interest due to their unique properties and potential applications in biomedicine, environmental remediation, energy storage, and catalysis. The fabrication of CuFe2O4 NPs using green synthesis method has gained attention as an eco-friendly alternative to conventional synthesis methods. We have provided a critical evaluation and comparison of the applications of CuFe2O4 NPs fabricated by the green synthesis method using bioresource extracts of such as plant, bacteria, fungi, virus, and algae. We highlight the advantages of using green synthesis methods, including reduced toxicity, lower energy consumption, and decreased environmental impact. We also discuss the challenges associated with the synthesis of CuFe2O4 NPs using bioresource extracts and provide future perspectives for the use of green synthesis methods in this area. This review aims to provide insights into the applications of CuFe2O4 NPs fabricated by the green synthesis method and to guide future research in this area. Graphical Abstract
