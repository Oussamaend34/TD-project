The present review reports the research carried out during last 9 years on biosensors based on cholinesterase inhibition for nerve agents, organophosphorus and carbammic insecticides, and aflatoxin B1 detection. Relative applications in environmental and food areas are also reported. Special attention is paid to the optimization of parameters such as enzyme immobilization, substrate concentration, and incubation time in the case of reversible inhibition by aflatoxin B1 or irreversible inhibition by organophosphorus and carbamic insecticides, and nerve agents in order to optimize and improve the analytical performances of the biosensor. Evaluation of selectivity of the system is also discussed.
