Sexual dysfunction is defined as a disturbance of the processes that characterise the sexual response cycle or as pain associated with sexual intercourse. The objective of this epidemiological study, conducted in a representative sample of the population of women aged 20 and older in Casablanca, Morocco, is to determine the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in women. Criteria of sexual dysfunction followed classification by DSM-IV. The mean age of the sample (n = 728) was 36.76 ± 12.67 years; 29% had no education, 78% pursued no professional activity; and 58% were married. The main results were that 26.6% had sexual dysfunction always or often during the 6 months before the study. The most common finding was hypoactive sexual desire disorder, and age, financial dependency, number of children, and sexual harassment were positively associated. The prevalence of remaining disorders resembled that found in the literature. Even though these women were aware about their disorder and its negative impact on their lives, only 17% of them asked for help.
