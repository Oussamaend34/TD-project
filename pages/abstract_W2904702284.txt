Evaluation of 50 nm zinc oxide nanoparticles’ (ZnO-NPs) effects on the microalgae Chlorococcum sp. growing in high salt growth medium (HSM) was investigated by using flow cytometry parameters (cell size (FSC), granularity (SSC), chlorophyll a fluorescence (FL3), and formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)). Algal cells in exponential growth were exposed to 0–100 mg/L of ZnO-NPs and their physiological responses were measured after 24 and 96 h of treatment. Behavior of ZnO-NPs was analyzed in HSM and results indicated that ZnO-NPs formed agglomeration with a large distribution. Total soluble Zn concentration increased when initial ZnO-NP concentration increased. Significant negative effect on algal cells was observed after 96 h exposition and at high ZnO-NP concentration. This negative impact was evaluated by the significant increase in ROS production, inhibition in the photosynthetic electron transport, and reduction in cell growth. In this study, using flow cytometry multi-parameters might help to prevent and evaluate inhibitory effect of oxide nanoparticles on aquatic photosynthetic microorganisms.
