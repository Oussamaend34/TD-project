Glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH) are the most widely used pesticides worldwide. Despite considerable progress in describing the neurotoxic potential of GBH, the harmful effects on brain cytoarchitecture and behavior are still unclear. Here, we addressed the developmental impact of GBH by exposing female mice to 250 or 500 mg/kg doses of GBH during both pregnancy and lactation and then examined the downstream effects at the behavioral, neurochemical and molecular levels. We show that pre- and neonatal exposure to GBH impairs fertility and reproduction parameters as well as maternal behavior of exposed mothers. In offspring, GBH was responsible for a global delay in innate reflexes and a deficit in motor development. At the adult age, exposed animals showed a decrease of locomotor activity, sociability, learning and short- and long-term memory associated with alterations of cholinergic and dopaminergic systems. Furthermore, GBH-activated microglia and astrocytes, sign of neuroinflammation event in the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. At the molecular level, a down-regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression and an up-regulation of tyrosine-related kinase receptor (TrkB), NR1 subunit of NMDA receptor as well as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) were found in the brain of GBH-exposed mice. The present work demonstrates that GBH induces numerous behavioral and cognitive abnormalities closely associated with significant histological, neurochemical and molecular impairments. It also raises fundamental concerns about the ability of current safety testing to assess risks of pesticide exposure during developmental periods of central nervous system.
