Abstract Context: Medicinal and aromatic plants are used by people for various purposes, whether for health care, beauty, or as a food source. Aims: To valorize the knowledge about their uses, therapeutic, cosmetic, and food. Methods: The ethnobotanical study was conducted from November 1, 2019, to March 1, 2021, in the Moulay Yacoub region. A total of 407 local informants were interviewed. The methodological approach was open-ended and semi-structured interviews with open-ended questions based on therapeutic, cosmetic, and dietary criteria. Quantitative analyses were performed using basic statistics, use value (UV), family use value (FUV), plant part value (PPV), and informant agreement ratio (IAR). Results: A total of 104 plant species belonging to 46 families were identified. The majority of plants are used in phytotherapy (78.30%). The most frequent ailments reported were digestive (IAR = 0.9). The most used method of preparation was infusion (42.68%), the leaves were the most used part of the plant (PPV = 0.45), and Anchusa italica Retz (UV = 0.196) was the most commonly prescribed species by local herbalists, and Oleaceae (FUV = 0.16) was the most dominant family. Conclusions: This study showed the richness of the plants and the consistency of the knowledge of the natives on medicinal and aromatic plants. As part of this study, we are currently working on plants with curative effects to prove their efficacy in animal models, including Anchusa italica Retz, which was widely cited in this ethnobotanical study. Authors invite scientists to conduct further phytochemical and pharmacological research on medicinal plants from this region based on this study.
