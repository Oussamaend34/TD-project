This review examines the potential of cellulose-based materials in controlled-release fertilizers (CRFs), with a particular focus on their structural characteristics, synthesis, modification, and agricultural applications. While previous reviews have explored aspects such as cellulose composites, stimulus-responsive hydrogels, and agrochemical formulations, our review is distinctive in that it provides a comprehensive and detailed study of cellulose characteristics and modification methods. This review places particular emphasis on the importance of surface functionalization in enhancing the properties of cellulose for use in controlled-release fertilizers (CRFs). Furthermore, our review examines recent developments in the utilization of cellulose-based CRFs and cellulose hydrogels for the alleviation of drought stress, elucidating their agronomic benefits, including phytotoxicity considerations, enhanced plant production, and impacts on soil properties. Additionally, we assess the biodegradability of these biomaterials, thereby advancing sustainable agricultural practices. Our objective is to provide a comprehensive understanding and novel insights for researchers and practitioners seeking to enhance crop productivity and environmental sustainability in agriculture.
