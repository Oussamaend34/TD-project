The presence of populations potentially harmful dinoflagellate phytoplankton like Oxyrrhis marina requires vigilance and control, because these species, in high density or under certain conditions, can have serious economic consequences and a negative impact on public health. In this investigation, we formulate bioeconomic model of a prey and predator planktonic species. The positivity and boundedness of the solution are studied. The possible equilibriums and their local stability are analyzed; also the global stability of the system around the interior equilibrium is established. We examine the optimal harvesting policy to discuss the dynamical profit of the interacting planktonic species. To show the impact of the toxicity coefficient, we have made analytical estimates that are validated using simulations.
