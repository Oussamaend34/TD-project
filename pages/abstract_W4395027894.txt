Adsorption column blockage due to solid adsorbent material is prevalent in laboratory-scale applications. Creating composite materials with stable geometries offers a viable solution. By crafting hydrogel beads using sodium alginate (Alg) and a bio-source like activated carbon (RMCA-P), it becomes possible to effectively eliminate agricultural pollutants, including the pesticide 2,4-D, from aqueous solutions. To evaluate the performance of these beads, a range of structural and textural analyses such as DRX, FTIR, SEM/EDX, BET, Zeta potential, Boehm titration, and iodine number were employed. Moreover, the study found that optimizing certain parameters greatly enhanced adsorption column efficiency. Specifically, increasing the bed height while reducing the flow rate of the adsorbate and the initial concentration in the inlet proved beneficial. The column demonstrated peak performance at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min, a bed height of 35 cm, and an inlet adsorbate concentration of 50 mg/L. Under these conditions, the highest recorded removal rate for 2,4-D was 95.49%, which was subsequently confirmed experimentally at 95.05%. Both the Thomas and Yoon-Nelson models exhibited a good fit with the breakthrough curves. After undergoing three cycles of reuse, the RMCA-P/Alg hydrogel composite maintained a 2,4-D removal percentage of 74.21%. Notably, the RMCA-P/Alg beads exhibited effective removal of 2,4-D from herbicidal field waters in a continuous operational mode.
