When activated, platelets undergo a conformational change that allows the release of numerous effector molecules as well as the production of extracellular vesicles, which are circulating submicron vesicles (10 to 1,000 nm in diameter) released into the extracellular space. Extracellular vesicles are formed by the budding of platelet and they carry some of its contents, including nucleic acids, surface proteins, and organelles. While platelets cannot cross tissue barriers, platelet-derived extracellular vesicles can enter the lymph, bone marrow, and synovial fluid. This allows the transfer of diverse contents carried by these platelet-derived vesicles to cell recipients and organs inaccessible to platelets where they can perform many functions. This review highlights the importance of these platelet-derived extracellular vesicles under different physiological and pathophysiological conditions.
