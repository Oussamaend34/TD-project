Based on a structural family of thirty-two NR2B-selective N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists, two phenylpiperazine derivatives labeled C37 and C39 were conceived thanks to molecular modeling techniques, as novel NMDAR inhibitors exhibiting the highest analgesic activities (of pIC50 order) against neuropathic pain, with excellent ADME-toxicity profiles, and good levels of molecular stability towards the targeted protein of NMDA receptor. Initially, the quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) models were developed using multiple linear regression (MLR), partial least square regression (PLSR), multiple non-linear regression (MNLR), and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques, revealing that analgesic activity was strongly correlated with dipole moment, octanol/water partition coefficient, Oxygen mass percentage, electronegativity, and energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, whose the correlation coefficients of generated models were: 0.860, 0.758, 0.885 and 0.977, respectively. The predictive capacity of each model was evaluated by an external validation with correlation coefficients of 0.703, 0.851, 0.778, and 0.981 respectively, followed by a cross-validation technique with the leave-one-out procedure (CVLOO) with Q2cv of 0.785, more than Y-randomization test, and applicability domain (AD), in addition to Fisher’s and Student’s statistical tests. Thereafter, ten novel molecules were designed based on MLR QSAR model, then predicted with their ADME-Toxicity profiles and subsequently examined for their similarity to the drug candidates. Finally, two of the most active compounds (C37 and C39) were chosen for molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) investigations during 100 ns of MD simulation time in complex with the targeted protein of NMDA receptor (5EWJ.pdb).
