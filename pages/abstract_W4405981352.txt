Environmental negotiations are complex, and conveying the interaction between science and policy in traditional teaching methods is challenging. To address this issue, innovative educational approaches like serious gaming and role-playing games have emerged. These methods allow students to actively explore the roles of different stakeholders in environmental decision-making and weigh for instance between sometimes conflicting UN Sustainable Development Goals or other dilemmas. In this work the phosphorus negotiation game (P-Game) is for the first time introduced. We present the initial quantitative and qualitative findings derived from engaging 788 students at various academic levels (Bachelor, Master, PhD, and Postdoc) across three continents and spanning 22 different countries. Quantitative results indicate that female participants and MSc students benefitted the most significantly from the P-Game, with their self-reported knowledge about phosphorus science and negotiation science/practice increasing by 71–93% (overall), 86–100% (females), and 73–106% (MSc students in general). Qualitative findings reveal that the P-Game can be smoothly conducted with students from diverse educational and cultural backgrounds. Moreover, students highly value their participation in the P-Game, which can be completed in just 2–3 h. This game not only encourages active engagement among participants but also provides valuable insights into the complex environmental issues associated with global phosphorus production. We strongly believe that the underlying methodology described here could also be used for other topics.
