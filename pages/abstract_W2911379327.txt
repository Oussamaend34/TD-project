Abstract Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality are not new technologies. But several constraints prevented their actual adoption. Recent technological progresses added to the proliferation of affordable hardware and software have made AR and VR more viable and desirable in many domains, including educa-tion; they have been relaunched with new promises previously unimaginable. The nature of AR and VR promises new teaching and learning models that better meet the needs of the 21st century learner. We’re now on a path to re-invent education. This work consists of explaining the reasons behind the new rise of AR and VR and why their actual adoption in education will be a reality in a near fu-ture.
