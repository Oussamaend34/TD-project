Within the effective mass and the parabolic band approximations, the binding energy of an on-center shallow donor impurity in a $$\mathrm{GaAs}/{\mathrm{Ga}}_{1-x}{\mathrm{Al}}_{x}\mathrm{As}$$ GaAs / Ga 1 - x Al x As multilayered spherical quantum dot has been studied by using the Finite Element Method (FEM). The ground state energy is calculated as a function of the barrier width and inner dot radius for different values of the confinement potential height. Our numerical results exhibit that the binding energy depends strongly on the width of the structure layers. In addition, we have investigated the effect of pressure, temperature, and electric field on the shallow donor binding energy. The calculations showed that the pressure yielded a significant improvement in the binding energy, especially for small inner dot radii. We have also remarked that the presence of temperature leads to a decrease in the binding energy, and the electric field produces a significant effect on the binding energy except for small barrier widths, where the coupling effect between the dots is the most dominant.
