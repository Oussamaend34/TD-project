Abstract A novel sustainable hydrogel catalyst based on the reaction of sodium alginate naturally extracted from brown algae Laminaria digitata residue with copper(II) was prepared as spherical beads, namely Cu(II)-alginate hydrogel (Cu(II)-AHG). The morphology and structural characteristics of these beads were elucidated by different techniques such as SEM, EDX, BET, FTIR and TGA analysis. Cu(II)-AHG and its dried form, namely Cu(II)-alginate (Cu(II)-AD), are relatively uniform with an average pore ranging from 200 nm to more than 20 μm. These superporous structure beads were employed for the copper catalyzed [3 + 2] cycloaddition reaction of aryl azides and terminal aryl alkynes (CuAAC) via click chemistry at low catalyst loading, using water as a solvent at room temperature and pressure. The catalytic active copper(I) species was generated by the reduction of copper(II) by terminal alkyne via the oxidative alkyne homocoupling reaction. The prepared catalysts were found to be efficient (85–92%) and regioselective by affording only 1,4-disubstituted-1,2,3-triazoles. They were also recoverable and reused in their dried form for at least four consecutive times without a clear loss of efficiency. A mechanistic study was performed through density functional theory (DFT) calculations in order to explain the regioselectivity outcome of Cu(II)-alginate in CuAAC reactions. The analysis of the local electrophilicity (ωk) at the electrophilic reagent and the local nucleophilicity (Nk) at the nucleophilic confirms the polar character of CuAAC. This catalyst has the main advantage of being sustainably ligand-free and recyclable.
