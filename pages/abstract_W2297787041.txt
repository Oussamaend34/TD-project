Abstract It’s worth noting that the present paper lies within the range of modeling the learner in adaptive educational system as a conceptual modeling of the learner. Thought they are several methods that deal with the learner model; like stereotypes methods or learner profile…, but they are likely unable to handle the uncertainty embedded in the dynamic modeling of the learner. The present paper aims at studding different models and approaches to model the learner in an adaptive educational systems, and coming up with the most appropriate method based on the dynamic aspect of this model.The aim of this study is the argue that the learner model cannot be completely modeled based on one single method through the entire development process, but it needs a combination between several methods that will help for a complete modeling.
