This paper presents the muon momentum calibration and performance studies for the ATLAS detector based on the pp collisions data sample produced at $$\sqrt{s}$$ s = 13 TeV at the LHC during Run 2 and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 $${\textrm{fb}}^{-1}$$ fb - 1 . An innovative approach is used to correct for potential charge-dependent momentum biases related to the knowledge of the detector geometry, using the $$Z\rightarrow \mu ^{+}\mu ^{-}$$ Z → μ + μ - resonance. The muon momentum scale and resolution are measured using samples of $$J/\psi \rightarrow \mu ^{+}\mu ^{-}$$ J / ψ → μ + μ - and $$Z\rightarrow \mu ^{+}\mu ^{-}$$ Z → μ + μ - events. A calibration procedure is defined and applied to simulated data to match the performance measured in real data. The calibration is validated using an independent sample of $$\Upsilon \rightarrow \mu ^{+}\mu ^{-}$$ Υ → μ + μ - events. At the Z $$(J/\psi )$$ ( J / ψ ) peak, the momentum scale is measured with an uncertainty at the 0.05% (0.1%) level, and the resolution is measured with an uncertainty at the 1.5% (2%) level. The charge-dependent bias is removed with a dedicated in situ correction for momenta up to 450 GeV with a precision better than 0.03 $${\textrm{TeV}}^{-1}$$ TeV - 1 .
