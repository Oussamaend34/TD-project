In this note we answer two question posed by Berkani and Koliha [Acta Sci. Math.69 (2003), 359–376]. We show that generalized Browder's (resp. generalized $a$-Browder's) theorem holds for a Banach space operator if and only if Browder's (resp. $a$-Browder's) theorem does. We also give condition under which generalized Weyl's (resp. generalized $a$-Weyl's) theorem is equivalent to Weyl's (resp. $a$-Weyl's) theorem.
