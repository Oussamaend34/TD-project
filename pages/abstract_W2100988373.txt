Understanding the mechanisms that underlie nutrient use efficiency and carbon allocation along with mycorrhizal interactions is critical for managing croplands and forests soundly. Indeed, nutrient availability, uptake and exchange in biotrophic interactions drive plant growth and modulate biomass allocation. These parameters are crucial for plant yield, a major issue in the context of high biomass production. Transport processes across the polarized membrane interfaces are of major importance in the functioning of the established mycorrhizal association as the symbiotic relationship is based on a ‘fair trade’ between the fungus and the host plant. Nutrient and/or metabolite uptake and exchanges, at biotrophic interfaces, are controlled by membrane transporters whose regulation patterns are essential for determining the outcome of plant–fungus interactions and adapting to changes in soil nutrient quantity and/or quality. In the present review, we summarize the current state of the art regarding transport systems in the two major forms of mycorrhiza, namely ecto- and arbuscular mycorrhiza.
