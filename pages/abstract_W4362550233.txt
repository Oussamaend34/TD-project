Abstract Research background: Sustainability in organizations is a business approach to creating long-term value by taking into consideration how a given organization operates in the ecological, social, and economic environments. The organizational practices that eventually lead to sustainable development are referred to as sustainable organization management. Purpose of the article: The purpose of this paper is to examine the current trends in sustainable organization management over the time period of 2015?2022, highlight the emerging themes in this study area, and provide guidance for further research in the field. Methods: This paper uses bibliometric meta-data analysis to present an analysis of current trends in sustainable organizational management. An in-depth analysis of a sample result of 619 papers from the Web of Science core collection was conducted with the use of biblioshiny, the R-Programming Language package, and the VoS Viewer software. A global representation of concepts was created using the relational directory network visualization technique based on VoS Viewer software. Keyword cooccurrence relationships were determined; relational techniques were used to visualize bibliographic coupling density to identify thematic areas with little research; and overlay visualization bibliometric techniques were used to identify new and old research themes. Findings & value added: Emerging themes are modeling, tourism, and perceptions. Motor theme areas in the field of study include performance, impact, and management. The paper concludes that the study area of organizational sustainability management is still in its early stages and has great research potential, such as Africa as a study area, despite the fact that there have been few or no research findings. Future research should examine the role of technology and innovation in promoting sustainable practices within organizations and clarify how well an organization can survive global competition.
