Editors' Summary Background Acute lower respiratory infections—bacterial and viral infections of the lungs and airways (the tubes that take oxygen-rich air to the lungs)—are major causes of illness and death in children worldwide. Pneumonia (infection of the lungs) alone is responsible for 15% of deaths among children under five years old and kills nearly one million young children every year. Globally, infections with respiratory syncytial virus and with Streptococcus pneumoniae are associated with about 25% and 18.3%, respectively, of all episodes of severe respiratory infection in young children. Another infectious organism that contributes to the global burden of respiratory disease among children is the influenza virus. Every year, millions of people become infected with this virus, which infects the airways and causes symptoms that include a high temperature, tiredness and weakness, general aches and pains, and a dry chesty cough. Most infected individuals recover quickly, but seasonal influenza outbreaks (epidemics) nevertheless kill about half a million people annually, with the highest burden of severe disease being experienced by elderly people and by children under five years old.
