The study was designed to explore the corrosion prevention capabilities of Citrullus colocynthis seeds alkaloid-rich extract (CSEA) on MS in a 1M HCl environment by use of electrochemical and theoretical methods. Notably, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic polarization were used to probe the impact of immersion time and temperature. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and spanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to confirm the presence of a protective layer on the substrate surface. Density functional theory (DFT) method was used to optimize the investigated species by use of B3LYP/6–31 + G(d, p) level of theory. The global and local quantum chemical reactivity descriptors were calculated to explore the inhibition corrosion efficiency and to identify the most favorable sites for electrophilic and nucleophilic attacks. Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) methods were used to study the interactions between corrosion inhibitor and metal surface. Noteworthy, results showed that CSEA exhibited an impressive inhibition efficiency, which reached 94.3% with a concentration of 2g/L at 298K. Potentiodynamic polarization revealed that the extract acted as a mixed-type inhibitor. Nyquist graphs showed that charge-transfer resistance and dæouble-layer capacitance both rised with increasing CSEA concentration, suggesting better inhibition efficiency. Notably, the Langmuir adsorption isotherm is well-aligned with the adsorption of inhibitor compounds. Importantly, all aforementioned theoretical methods were in agreement with the experimental findings. The outcome of the present work supported using Citrullus colocynthis seeds alkaloid-rich extract as ecofriendly agents to prevent corrosion.
