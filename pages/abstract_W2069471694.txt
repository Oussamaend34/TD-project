Abstract Digestibility is the result of two competing processes: digestion and digesta transit. To develop or parameterise mechanistic models of digestion, both processes have to be quantified. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of insoluble dietary fibre on the transit in the gastrointestinal tract of pigs. Six barrows (33 kg initial body weight and fitted with two simple T-cannulas at the proximal duodenum and distal ileum) were used in a double 3 × 3 Latin square design. Pigs were offered diets differing in total dietary fibre content (170, 220 and 270 g/kg DM) at 4 h intervals. A single meal marked with YbO2 and Cr-EDTA was used to determine the kinetics of markers concentrations of the solid and liquid phases, respectively. The mean retention time (MRT), calculated by the method of the moments, averaged 1, 4 and 38 h in the stomach, small intestine and large intestine, respectively. Increasing the insoluble fibre content in the diet had no effect on MRT in the stomach and decreased the MRT of both phases in the small intestine (P < 0·05). In the large intestine, increasing the insoluble fibre content decreased the MRT of the liquid phase (P = 0·02) and tended to decrease the MRT of the solid phase (P = 0·06). Transit of the solid phase in the large intestine was 4–8 h slower than transit of the liquid phase. Analysis of marker excretion curves indicated that the small and large intestine should be represented mathematically to have both a tubular (propulsion) and compartmental (mixing) structure.
