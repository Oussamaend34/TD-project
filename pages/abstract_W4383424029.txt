Skin diseases represent a variety of disorders that can affect the skin. In fact, early diagnosis plays a central role in the treatment of this type of disease. This scholarly article introduces a novel approach to classifying skin diseases by leveraging two ensemble learning techniques, encompassing multi-modal and multi-task methodologies. The proposed classifier integrates diverse information sources, including skin lesion images and patient-specific data, aiming to enhance the accuracy of disease classification. By simultaneously utilizing image input and structured data input, the multi-task functionality of the classifier enables efficient disease classification. The integration of multi-modal and multi-task techniques allows for a comprehensive analysis of skin diseases, leading to improved classification performance and a more holistic understanding of the underlying factors influencing disease diagnosis. The efficacy of the classifier was assessed using the ISIC 2018 dataset, which comprises both image and clinical information for each patient with skin diseases. The dataset used in this study comprises images of seven different types of skin diseases and their associated medical information. The findings of our proposed approach show that it outperforms traditional single-modal and single-task classifiers. The results of this study demonstrate that the proposed model attained an accuracy of 97.66% for the initial classification task (image classification). Additionally, the second classification task (clinical data classification) achieved an accuracy of 94.40%.
