Abstract The Albian-Cenomanian reservoirs of the Ivorian sedimentary basin consist mainly of conglomeratic, pebbly, and very fine to coarse-grained sandstones. In the present study, the lithologic composition, flow and storage capacities, and reservoir quality parameters were studied in detail. Some fresh, clean and non-fractured samples were selected representative from FE-1 well in the depocenter of the basin, FE-2 well to the west, and FE-3 well to the east of the basin. Lithologic studies indicated that heterogeneity increases greatly to the east due to the implementation of diagenetic factors including cementation, silicification, authigenic clay minerals, and compaction. Though of the dominant reservoir quality-reducing factors, to the east, the reservoir quality increases due to increasing the grain size and the interstitial pore types. Porosity and permeability of samples were estimated by helium and nitrogen injection, respectively, whereas the reservoir quality was measured using different techniques, e.g., the FZI (flow zone indicator), the RQI (reservoir quality index), the effective pore radius (R35) of Winland, and the DRT (discrete rock type). The reservoir quality properties declared that the present plug samples can be clustered into six RRTs (reservoir rock types), with increasing reservoir quality from RRT6 (conglomeratic sandstone lithofacies) to RRT1 (deformed sandstone lithofacies). Article highlights The Albian-Cenomanian Ivorian reservoirs consist of conglomeratic to very fine-grained sandstones. Reservoir quality increases to the east by increasing the grain size and the pore sizes. Six reservoir rock types (RRTs); RRT1 samples are characterized by the lowest reservoir quality.
