Abstract Traffic congestion prediction is one of the essential components of intelligent transport systems (ITS). This is due to the rapid growth of population and, consequently, the high number of vehicles in cities. Nowadays, the problem of traffic congestion attracts more and more attention from researchers in the field of ITS. Traffic congestion can be predicted in advance by analyzing traffic flow data. In this article, we used machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, random forest regressor, decision tree regressor, gradient boosting regressor, and K-neighbor regressor to predict traffic flow and reduce traffic congestion at intersections. We used the public roads dataset from the UK national road traffic to test our models. All machine learning algorithms obtained good performance metrics, indicating that they are valid for implementation in smart traffic light systems. Next, we implemented an adaptive traffic light system based on a random forest regressor model, which adjusts the timing of green and red lights depending on the road width, traffic density, types of vehicles, and expected traffic. Simulations of the proposed system show a 30.8% reduction in traffic congestion, thus justifying its effectiveness and the interest of deploying it to regulate the signaling problem in intersections.
