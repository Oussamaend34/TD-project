Sr2 is the only known durable, race non-specific adult plant stem rust resistance gene in wheat. The Sr2 gene was shown to be tightly linked to the leaf rust resistance gene Lr27 and to powdery mildew resistance. An analysis of recombinants and mutants suggests that a single gene on chromosome arm 3BS may be responsible for resistance to these three fungal pathogens. The resistance functions of the Sr2 locus are compared and contrasted with those of the adult plant resistance gene Lr34.
