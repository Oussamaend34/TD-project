In this paper, we propose efficient methods for the reconstruction, compression, compressive sensing (CS) and encryption of 1D signals. The proposed reconstruction method is based on the use of Charlier moments (CMs) and the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm. The latter is used for optimizing the local parameter of Charlier polynomials during the computation of CMs. In addition, new methods are presented for 1D signal compression and CS using CMs and ABC algorithm that guarantees a high quality of the decompressed/reconstructed signal. Moreover, we suggest a new signal encryption/decryption scheme relying on fractional-order Charlier moments and ABC algorithm, which is used for providing a high quality of the decrypted signal and for improving the security of the proposed scheme. The results of the conducted simulations and comparisons clearly show the efficiency of the proposed 1D-signal analysis methods.
