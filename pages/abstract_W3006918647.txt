The delineation of favourable areas of water potentials and their management must be based on rigorous scientific studies. Thus, geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) techniques are extremely important in predicting and mapping favourable groundwater zones. This paper aims to map potential areas of groundwater in Waddai region, eastern Chad. A region which has experienced successive droughts over the last two decades, causing the drying of most of the rivers in the area. This study focuses on combining GIS, RS, and analytical hierarchy process; in addition to the factors controlling the movement and retention of groundwater. Six factors (rainfall, slope, land use/land cover, drainage density, lineament density, and lithology) were used to integrate the spatial analysis of areas likely to hold groundwater. The results indicate that potential groundwater areas are unevenly distributed throughout the study area. For instance, the northwestern part is characterized by a low groundwater potential. This low potential in this part of the study area as well as a small portion of the eastern area is explained by a low density of lineaments and drainage, the presence of moderate precipitations, and a semi-permeable lithology (alternating hard rocks and loose sediments). While every low and moderate area occupy most of the middle of the region, good ground water reservoirs occupy a large part of the region. This distribution is explained by good fracturing, permeability, lineament density, high drainage, gentle slope, and precipitation. Therefore, areas of the northwestern part are highly suitable for groundwater exploration and exploitation. Hence; these results would be a guide for future explorations and will maximizes the economic efficiency of the ground water exploitation processes. Furthermore, this map will be useful as a guide in decision-making and on water policy planning.
