Superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) are a class of cross-coupled hydrophilic networks that have an extraordinary capacity to absorb and retain water. It is primarily because of the additional ionic cross-linking of SAPs, their porous wavy structure, a large number of hydrophilic functionalities, the high elasticity of the chains, and the enlarged free volumes between the polymeric chains, that all contribute to the enhancement of the swelling capability of superabsorbent hydrogels. These exceptional attributes have endowed them to be an alternative to conventional hydrogels in various applications. In view of the importance of this class of absorbent material and their diverse appliances, this review deliberates the experimental methods for characterizing superabsorbent polymers, including the officially accepted industrial measurements of their unique attributes, namely, swelling among others. In addition, the review highlights recent advances in the field of superabsorbent polymers encompassing nanofiltration, heat resistance, and absorbency, drug delivery, disposable hygiene products, nanomedicines, and the removal of heavy metals from wastewater and agriculture domains.
