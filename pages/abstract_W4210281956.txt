In order to optimize the water purification and treatment of polluted water, a new degradation technique of the organic matter called “heterogeneous photocatalysis” has been highlighted. Titanium dioxide TiO2 semiconductor doped with Ni has been chosen as photocatalyst, which has been prepared by coprecipitation. The characterization of synthesized catalysts has been carried out using transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy as well as EDS. The obtained adsorption results showed that the dye adsorbs better on doped TiO2 nanoparticles rather than pure TiO2. The kinetics of photodegradation was studied as a function of several parameters, such as the concentration and the nature of the catalysts, the doping element and the initial concentration of methyl orange dye. Comparisons of degradation kinetics of methyl orange using TiO2 semiconductors have shown that pure TiO2 Sachtopore and doped TiO2 Sachtopore at 0.1% are less active compared to TiO2 P25 and doped TiO2 Sachtopore at 0.2% since they provide comparable performance.
