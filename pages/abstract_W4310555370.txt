This work explores the magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) Jeffery–Hamel nanofluid flow between two rigid non-parallel plane walls with heat transfer by employing hybrid nanoparticles, especially Cu and Cu-Al $$_{2}$$ O $$_{3}$$ . Here the MHD nanofluid flow problem is extended with fuzzy volume fraction and heat transfer with diverse nanoparticles to cover the influence of thermal profiles with hybrid nanoparticles on the fuzzy velocity profiles. The nanoparticle volume fraction is described with a triangular fuzzy number ranging from 0 to $$5\%$$ . A novel double parametric form-based homotopy analysis approach is considered to study the fuzzy velocity and temperature profiles with hybrid nanoparticles in both convergent and divergent channel positions. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed method has been demonstrated by comparing it with the available results in a crisp environment for validation.
