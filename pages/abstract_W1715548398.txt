Background Bacterivores, mostly represented by protists and nematodes, are a key component of soil biodiversity involved in soil fertility and plant productivity. In the current context of global change and soil biodiversity erosion, it becomes urgent to suitably recognize and quantify their ecological importance in ecosystem functioning. Scope Using meta-analysis tools, we aimed at providing a quantitative synthesis of the ecological importance of soil bacterivores on ecosystem functions. We also intended to produce an overview of the ecological factors that are expected to drive the magnitude of bacterivore effects on ecosystem functions. Conclusions Bacterivores in soil contributed significantly to numerous key ecosystem functions. We propose a new theoretical framework based on ecological stoichiometry stressing the role of C:N:P ratios in soil, microbial and plant biomass as important parameters driving bacterivore-effects on soil N and P availability for plants, immobilization of N and P in the bacterial biomass, and plant responses in nutrition and growth.
