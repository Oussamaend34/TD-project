The restriction patterns of two chloroplast fragments and one mitochondrial DNA fragment, amplified by PCR with universal primers, were studied to determine the mode of inheritance of these organelles in 143 progeny of five intraspecific crosses in pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.). The results indicate that both genomes are maternally inherited, an observation which agrees with the commonly observed pattern of inheritance in angiosperms. They confirm that both chloroplast DNA and mitochondrial DNA can be used as a source of seed-specific markers for the study of the geographic structure of oaks. This is the first report of organelle inheritance within the Fagaceae, an important and widespread tree family.
