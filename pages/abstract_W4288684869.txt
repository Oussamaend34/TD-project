Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the widespread use of distributed intelligent objects equipped with various components such as captors, activators, and processors that interact in private, public, and professional environments without requiring human intervention. The growing quantity and popularity of these distributed smart objects have made them extremely vulnerable to malicious attacks. A significant volume of research works has been proposed to address security issues in IoT. For instance, various kinds of techniques have been integrated to make IoT environments more secure, including authentication, access, cryptography, and data integrity. Actually, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) is a powerful security tool that can be upgraded by using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms. They were developed to improve standard performance metrics, like accuracy (ACC), recall, and precision, yet rarely consider the time processing capabilities. In this paper, we introduce an optimized intrusion detection approach using gradient boosting (GB) and decision tree (DT) for IoT security. In particular, the GB and DT algorithms through the open-source Catboost. The proposed model was evaluated on the enhanced NSL-KDD, BoT-IoT, and IoT-23 datasets. The GPU is used to improve the experimental framework. In comparison with the well-existing IDS, the obtained results demonstrate that our approach gives good performance in terms of ACC, recall, precision, and F1-score metrics more than 99.9% with record detection and computation time.
