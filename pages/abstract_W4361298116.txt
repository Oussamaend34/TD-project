This work presented a study of nonlinear optical rectification (NOR) in a double quantum dot (DQD) made of $$\mathrm{GaAs}{/\mathrm{Ga}}_{1-\upeta }{\mathrm{Al}}_{\upeta }\mathrm{As}$$ GaAs / Ga 1 - η Al η As under the influence of pressure (P) and temperature (T) in the presence of shallow donor impurities. Both the approximations of the parabolic band and effective mass, as well as the variational technique, were used as tools to calculate the electronic and optical properties of the donor impurity. The result revealed a redshift in the peak of the nonlinear optical rectification as the width of the DQD increases due to the reduction of the energy difference. The amplitude of the resonant peak of nonlinear optical rectification was tuned by changing the barrier width, depending on the location of the impurity. The findings also showed that the maximum value of NOR shifted to higher energies as the pressure increased. The temperature change caused a blueshift in the maximum peak of NOR for both impurity positions as well as a decrease in their amplitude. Under external perturbations P and T, the NOR varied more significantly for impurities located at the border of the DQD compared to those at the center position of the dot. This was due to the higher confinement effect induced by the external factors in this position.
