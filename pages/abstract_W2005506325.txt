Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are harmful to environment and human health. Catalytic oxidation has been used in VOC abatement for over 60 years, and it has proven to be an effective technology. A large variety of VOCs set high demands for the treatment, and therefore catalytic oxidation needs still to be developed further. This paper reviews current aspects and future research needs related to VOCs and catalytic VOC treatment concentrating on solvent-based, chlorinated and sulphur-containing VOCs.
