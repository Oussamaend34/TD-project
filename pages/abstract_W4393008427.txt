Abstract The growing apprehension surrounding heavy metal pollution in both environmental and industrial contexts has spurred extensive research into adsorption materials aimed at efficient remediation. Among these materials, Metal–Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have risen as versatile and promising contenders due to their adjustable properties, expansive surface areas, and sustainable characteristics, compared to traditional options like activated carbon and zeolites. This exhaustive review delves into the synthesis techniques, structural diversity, and adsorption capabilities of MOFs for the effective removal of heavy metals. The article explores the evolution of MOF design and fabrication methods, highlighting pivotal parameters influencing their adsorption performance, such as pore size, surface area, and the presence of functional groups. In this perspective review, a thorough analysis of various MOFs is presented, emphasizing the crucial role of ligands and metal nodes in adapting MOF properties for heavy metal removal. Moreover, the review delves into recent advancements in MOF-based composites and hybrid materials, shedding light on their heightened adsorption capacities, recyclability, and potential for regeneration. Challenges for optimization, regeneration efficiency and minimizing costs for large-scale applications are discussed.
