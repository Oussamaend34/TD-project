Security of information has become a popular subject during the last decades, it is the balanced protection of the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of data, also known as the CIA Triad. In this work, we introduce a new hybrid system based on two different encryption techniques: two square cipher and Caesar cipher with multiples keys. This homogeneity between the two systems allows us to provide the good properties of the two square cipher method and the simplicity of the Caesar cipher method. The security analysis shows that the system is secure enough to resist brute-force attack, and statistical attack. Therefore, this robustness is proven and justified.
