Abstract Background: Screening new natural molecules with pharmacological and/or cosmetic properties remains a highly sought-after area of research. Moreover, essential oils and volatile compounds have recently garnered significant interest as natural substance candidates. In this study, the volatile components of Pistacia lentiscus L. essential oils (PLEOs) isolated from the fruit and its main compounds, alpha-pinene, and limonene, are investigated for antioxidant, antidiabetic, and dermatoprotective activities. Methods: In vitro antioxidant activity was investigated using 2,2′-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), and 2,2-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) methods. The antidiabetic and dermatoprotective effects were studied using enzyme inhibitory activities. Results: Antioxidant tests showed that PLEO has the best activity (ranging from 29.64 ± 3.04 to 73.80 ± 3.96 µg/mL) compared to its main selected molecules (ranging from 74 ± 3.72 to 107.23 ± 5.03 µg/mL). The α-glucosidase and α-amylase assays demonstrated that the elements tested have a promising antidiabetic potential with IC50values ranging from 78.03 ± 2.31 to 116.03 ± 7.42 µg/mL and 74.39 ± 3.08 to 112.35 ± 4.92 µg/mL for the α-glucosidase and α-amylase assays, respectively, compared to the standard drug. For the tyrosinase test, we found that the EOs (IC50 = 57.72 ± 2.86 µg/mL) followed by limonene (IC50 = 74.24 ± 2.06 µg/mL) and α-pinene (IC50 = 97.45 ± 5.22 µg/mL) all exhibited greater inhibitory effects than quercetin (IC50 = 246.90 ± 2.54 µg/mL). Conclusions: Our results suggest that the biological activities of PLEO, as well as its main compounds, make them promising candidates for the development of new strategies aimed at improving dermatoprotection and treating diseases associated with diabetes mellitus and oxidative stress.
