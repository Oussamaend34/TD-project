Bitter vetch and sorghum grains are alternative local feed resources that are underutilized in the southern Mediterranean area. This study aimed to assess the effects of incorporating these grains into the diet of local goat breeds on growth performance, carcass characteristics, and meat quality. Twenty-four goat kids were divided into three groups. The control group received a conventional diet consisting of oat hay, barley, and fava beans. In the first group, fava beans were replaced with bitter vetch, and in the second group, barley was replaced with sorghum. At the end of the trial, the animals were slaughtered and carcass characteristics and meat fatty acid profiles of the longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle were determined. Alternative grain incorporation had no significant effect on the growth parameters. Still, it significantly affected carcass characteristics, especially in the sorghum group compared to the control group, where mesenteric fat was lower (266 vs. 437 g). The back color was lighter (L∗=55.1 vs. 59.1) and less yellow (a∗=−1.29 vs. 2.22). The diet also influenced the meat's chemical composition, with less protein and ash in the chevrons of animals receiving bitter vetch and sorghum grains, respectively. Regarding the fatty acid (FA) profile, sorghum grains had decreased C18:2 n-6 and polyunsaturated FA (PUFA), whereas bitter vetch grains had increased C18:3 n-3, elongase activity, and nutritive value index (NVI). The control group exhibited intermediate results for C15:0, C16:0, C16:1, C20:3 n-3, n-3, health promoting index (HPI), and thrombogenic index (TI). No significant effects were reported for saturated FA (SFA) and monounsaturated FA (MUFA). Bitter vetch and sorghum grains can be safely incorporated into fattening diets of goat kids.
