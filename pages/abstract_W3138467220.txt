Abstract Distance learning experiments have been launched since 2010 in several Moroccan universities as part of an experimental approach. It, therefore, seems to us that a strategy must be put in place to give this choice of education its place in training and grant it the means necessary to achieve these objectives. The objective of this paper has presented an overview, of free and proprietary e-learning platforms, their functional architectures, as well as the types of e-learning devices that can create from platforms e-learning. To deduce the state of the art of the e-learning provisions of Moroccan universities and compare them with the e-learning provisions of European and American universities.
