The magnetic properties of an Ising antiferromagnetic model on a nanographene lattice which have spins that can take the values S=±3/2, ±1/2, are studied by Monte Carlo simulations. We only consider the nearest-neighbor interactions between the sites i and j. The zero field cooled and field cooled magnetizations, magnetic susceptibilities and hysteresis cycle are obtained for a nanographene structure with the effect of exchange interaction between sites i and j. The blocking temperature is also obtained for specific values of the external magnetic field.
