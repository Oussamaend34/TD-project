Resistance to the root cyst nematode Globodera rostochiensis is an agronomic trait that is at present incorporated into most new potato varieties. Major dominant genes are available that originate from wild and cultivated Solanum species closely related to the cultivated European potato (Solanum tuberosum ssp. tuberosum). One of those genes, H1, from S. Tuberosum ssp. andigena, was mapped to a distal position on potato chromosome V using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers. The H1 locus segregates independently from Gro1, a second dominant gene presumably from S. Spegazzinii that confers resistance to G. Rostochiensis and which has been mapped to chromosome VII. One marker, CP113, was linked without recombination to the H1 locus.
