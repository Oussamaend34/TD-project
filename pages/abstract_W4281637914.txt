The study carried out in this paper is interested in the degradation of wastewater contaminated with dyes, by advanced oxidation processes, namely ozonation. This treatment is carried out by the oxidizing action of the hydroxyl radicals produced in the medium to be treated. These radicals are capable of degrading almost all persistent organic pollutants because of their very high oxidizing power, their reactivity and their non-selectivity towards organic substances. In this context, we carried out an ozonation study of an azo dye, Procion Blue. Parametric effects were applied in this work to study the change in pH over time, the effect of ozonation on dye removal, the effect of the initial dye concentration on ozonation and thé effect of the addition of H2O2 on the ozonation of Procion blue. This study showed that ozonation was very successful in the complete discoloration of a solution of Procion Blue (85%). The kinetic study carried out demonstrated that the experimental results follow pseudo-first-order kinetics. The ozonation process has been shown to be effective in decontaminating water polluted with dyes, which can reach very high levels of mineralization.
