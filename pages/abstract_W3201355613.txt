Cloud computing is new technology that has considerably changed human life at different aspect over the last decade. Especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, almost all life activity shifted into cloud base. Cloud computing is a utility where different hardware and software resources are accessed on pay per user ground base. Most of these resources are available in virtualized form and virtual machine (VM) is one of the main elements of visualization.VM used in data center for distribution of resource and application according to benefactor demand. Cloud data center faces different issue in respect of performance and efficiency for improvement of these issues different approaches are used. Virtual machine play important role for improvement of data center performance therefore different approach are used for improvement of virtual machine efficiency (i-e) load balancing of resource and task. For the improvement of this section different parameter of VM improve like makespan, quality of service, energy, data accuracy and network utilization. Improvement of different parameter in VM directly improve the performance of cloud computing. Therefore, we conducting this review paper that we can discuss about various improvements that took place in VM from 2015 to 20,201. This review paper also contain information about various parameter of cloud computing and final section of paper present the role of machine learning algorithm in VM as well load balancing approach along with the future direction of VM in cloud data center.
