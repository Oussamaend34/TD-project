Adipose cell-free derivatives have been recently gaining attention as potential therapeutic agents for various human diseases. In this context, mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs), adipocyte mesenchymal stem cells (Ad-MSCs) and adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC) possessing potent immunomodulatory activities are proposed as a therapeutic option for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The COVID-19 represents a global concern of public health caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in which there is not actually any specific therapy. MSCs exert an immunomodulation effect due to the secretion of endogenous factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), insulin growth factor (IGF), and nerve growth factor (NGF), transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and growth differentiation factor (GDF)-11. Recent reports are promising for further studies and clinical applications of ADSCs and Ad-MSCs in COVID-19 patients. Experimental and clinical studies are exploring the therapeutic potential of both MSCs and derived-exosomes in moderating the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. In this field, more preclinical and clinical studies are warranted to find an effective treatment for the patients suffering from COVID-19 infection.
