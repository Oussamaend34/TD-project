Plant biostimulants are defined as materials containing microorganisms or substances whose function when applied to plants or the rhizosphere is to stimulate natural mechanisms to enhance plant growth, nutrient use efficiency, tolerance to abiotic stressors and crop quality, independent of their nutrient content. In agriculture, seaweeds (Macroalgae) have been used in the production of plant biostimulants while microalgae still remain unexploited. Microalgae are single cell microscopic organisms (prokaryotic or eukaryotic) that grow in a range of aquatic habitats, including, wastewaters, pounds, lakes, rivers, oceans, and even humid soils. These photosynthetic microorganisms are widely described as renewable sources of biofuels, bioingredients and biologically active compounds, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), carotenoids, phycobiliproteins, sterols, vitamins and polysaccharides, which attract considerable interest in both scientific and industrial communities. Microalgae polysaccharides have so far proved to have several important biological activities, making them biomaterials and bioactive products of increasing importance for a wide range of applications. The present review describes microalgae polysaccharides, their biological activities and their possible application in agriculture as a potential sustainable alternative for enhanced crop performance, nutrient uptake and resilience to environmental stress. This review does not only present a comprehensive and systematic study of Microalgae polysaccharides as plant biostimulants but considers the fundamental and innovative principles underlying this technology.
