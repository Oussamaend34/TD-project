This study has a twofold goal. First, it investigates the internal structure of words and clauses in Standard Arabic (SA), in the light of recent developments of Government and Binding Theory (GB). Second, it argues for a specific theory of typology, and proposes a particular view of how parametrization can be construed and executed. SA is a language used throughout the Arab world, in contrast to specific local dialects which are limited to a particular area. The language has a number of features which make it particularly suitable for cross-linguistic comparative morpho-syntax, as well as research in different modules of the theory of grammar. SA morphology is essentially non-concatenative, though a rich analytic affixation system makes word formation hierarchical. Word order in SA is basically VSO, but the language has alternative SVO structures as well. Sentences can be 'nominal' (i.e. with no verb or copula realized at surface structure), or verbal. Arguments can be left syntacti­cally unexpressed (i.e. SA is a null argument language). SA is an agreement language, with a rich and complex agreement system interacting with word order, pronominal incorporation, and expletive structures. It also has a productive morphological case system. Tense, Aspect, Modal, and Negation properties interact in intriguing ways. Finally, SA's DP system exhibits interesting complementary distributions between overt determiners, genitive complements, and possessive markers. It also uses different licensing strategies for Genitive Case marking.
