In this paper, we propose a zero-watermarking scheme based on a new set of quaternion moments called Quaternion Radial Fractional Charlier Moments (QRFrCMs) for the copyright protection of color medical images. The proposed moments are developed from a new type of discrete orthogonal polynomials called Fractional Charlier Polynomials (FrCPs) and from quaternion theory. The robustness of the proposed scheme is ensured thanks to robustness of the proposed quaternion moments against image processing attacks and geometric attacks where the BCR is greater than 98%. In addition, the scheme uses the fractional order of QRFrCMs and a chaotic system based on two-dimensional CML (2DCML) using mixed linear-nonlinear coupling to provide a high level of security. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed scheme over other recent schemes in terms of robustness against geometric attacks and common image processing attacks. The proposed scheme can be used for the secure transmission of color medical images over insecure networks.
