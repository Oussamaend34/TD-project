Mining plays a central role in the global economy, making a substantial contribution to export earnings. Nevertheless, implementing sustainable mining practices that prioritise environmental responsibility during extraction remains a major challenge. In response, governments around the world have instituted policies, with the primary aim of promoting sustainable mining practices and preserving the ecosystem for future generations. Unfortunately, despite these efforts, mining operations continue to cause substantial ecological damage, marked by the transformation of landscapes and the fragmentation of ecosystems. Although regulations exist for the rehabilitation of areas degraded by mining activities, many technical aspects, particularly in relation to open-pit mining, remain poorly defined. In this article, we propose an in-depth look at a ‘green’ approach rooted in reclamation through revegetation-based techniques to address this critical issue. Although there are challenges such as species selection and harsh environmental conditions, revegetation and remediation techniques for reclamation offer many benefits, including soil enrichment, habitat restoration and promoting the recovery of local biodiversity. In addition, emerging technologies, such as nanomaterials, have demonstrated their effectiveness in improving soil fertility. They enable effective and long-term rehabilitation of soils disturbed by mining activities. Despite the considerable environmental impact associated with mining, the implementation of these innovative techniques promises to produce positive results and make a significant contribution to the sustainable development of the mining sector. By adopting environmentally friendly practices and constantly improving reclamation strategies, the mining industry can strive to reduce its ecological footprint and ensure a more sustainable future for itself and the surrounding ecosystems.
