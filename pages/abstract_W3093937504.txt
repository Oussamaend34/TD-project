Cloud Computing is an emerging paradigm that is based on the concept of distributed computing. Its definition is related to the use of computer resources which are offered as a service. As with any novel technology, Cloud Computing is subject to security threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks. Recently, the studies on security impact include the interaction of software, people and services on the Internet and that is called cyber-security or cyberspace security. In spite of various studies, we still fail to define the needs of cybersecurity management in Cloud Computing. This paper principally focuses on a comprehensive study of Cloud Computing concerns, security, cybersecurity differences, ISO, and NIST standards. It aims at identifying the policies and the guidelines included in these standards as well as it provides a comprehensive Framework proposal to manage and prevent cyber risks in Cloud Computing taking into consideration the ISO 27,032, ISO 27,001, ISO 27,017 and NIST cybersecurity Framework CSF. In addition to that, our study pinpoints at the criteria that concern measuring the maturity of organizations that implement the framework. Our objective is to provide guidance to organizations on how to establish their proper approach of cybersecurity risk management in Cloud Computing or to complement their ‘already have’ processes.
