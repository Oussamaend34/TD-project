In recent years, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) field has witnessed rapid growth, affecting diverse sectors, including education. In this systematic review of literature, we aimed to analyze studies concerning the integration of AI in the continuous professional development (CPD) of teachers in order to generate a global vision on its potential to enhance the quality of CPD programs in the international level, and to provide recommendations for its application in the Moroccan context. To achieve our objective, we conducted a research that involves a review of international indexed databases (Scopus, Web of Science, Eric) published between 2019 and 2023 using PICO framework to formulate our search query and PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework to select 25 relevant studies based on include and exclude criteria like publishing year, type of documents, publishing mode, subject area, language, and other criteria. The results reveal that AI integration has a positive impact on CPD programs by offering beneficial intelligent tools that can tailor adaptive training programs to meet teachers’ specific needs, preferences, and proficiency levels. Furthermore, our findings identify the importance of integrating AI as a core topic within CPD programs to enhance teachers’ AI literacy, enabling them to effectively navigate and utilize AI-based tools in their educational environment. This is important for preparing teachers to engage with the technological advances shaping the educational system. In conclusion, our systematic review emphasizes the significance of AI integration in CPD programs and offers tailored recommendations for its implementation in the Moroccan educational context. By adopting these recommendations, Morocco will pave the way for a dynamic CPD framework that meets the evolving needs of educators and students alike.
