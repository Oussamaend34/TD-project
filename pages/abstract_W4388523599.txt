Recent studies using cell type–specific knockout mouse models have improved our understanding of the pathophysiological relevance of suppressor of lin-12-like–HMG-CoA reductase degradation 1 (SEL1L-HRD1) endoplasmic reticulum–associated (ER-associated) degradation (ERAD); however, its importance in humans remains unclear, as no disease variant has been identified. Here, we report the identification of 3 biallelic missense variants of SEL1L and HRD1 (or SYVN1) in 6 children from 3 independent families presenting with developmental delay, intellectual disability, microcephaly, facial dysmorphisms, hypotonia, and/or ataxia. These SEL1L (p.Gly585Asp, p.Met528Arg) and HRD1 (p.Pro398Leu) variants were hypomorphic and impaired ERAD function at distinct steps of ERAD, including substrate recruitment (SEL1L p.Gly585Asp), SEL1L-HRD1 complex formation (SEL1L p.Met528Arg), and HRD1 activity (HRD1 p.Pro398Leu). Our study not only provides insights into the structure-function relationship of SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD, but also establishes the importance of SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD in humans.
