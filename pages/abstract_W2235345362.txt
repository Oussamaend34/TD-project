Main possible honey fraud is the addition of various sugar syrups. But, there are also other types of fraud, such as deception on the geographical and/or botanical origin product. Providing a product of the hive with full authenticity is therefore crucial for the preservation of beekeeping. In this pursuit, voltammetric electronic tongue (VE-tongue) was employed to classify honey samples from different geographical and botanical origins. Furthermore, VE-tongue was used to detect adulterants such as glucose syrup (GS) and saccharose syrup (SS) in honey. The data obtained were analyzed by three-pattern recognition techniques: principal component analysis (PCA), support vector machines (SVMs), and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). These methods enabled the classification of 18 honeys of different geographical origins and 7 honeys of different botanical origins. Excellent results were obtained also in the detection of adulterated honey. Therefore, this simple method based on VE-tongue could be useful in the honey packaging and commercialization industry.
