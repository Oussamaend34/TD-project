Eugenol (4-allyl-2-methoxyphenol) is a volatile phenolic bioactive compound derived from a natural resource. This compound has been identified in several aromatic plants, among which Syzygium aromaticum (L.) Merr. and L.M. Perry contains between 45 and 90% of eugenol in its essential oil compared to other natural sources. Eugenol has been studied over the years and has shown to display a wide range of biological activities as antifungal, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, analgesic, anticancer, and antiparasitic. It has been extensively used in cosmetics, in food processing industry, and also as a starting material for total synthesis of several natural products. The 4-allyl-2-methoxyphenol has a simple structure, which presents three active sites: hydroxyl, allylic, and aromatic groups. Thus, the chemistry of this natural component emphasizes its potential impact in the synthesis of novel drugs, compounds that can be useful for human resources. Therefore, the present article reviews the latest developments in the methodologies of synthesis, pharmacological properties, and further applications of eugenol derivatives.
