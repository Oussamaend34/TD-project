The main concern of this work is to analyze performance of hybrid nanoparticles in improving thermal behavior on Williamson fluid through the heated cylinder on convective heating. Graphene and magnetic oxide were diffused by the Williamson liquid concurrently. This model for efficient thermal properties by the hybrid nano-fluids (the mixture of graphene, Williamson fluid, and magnetic oxide) was applied to model this transfer of heat and its outcomes by the set of complex numerical expressions about momentum and energy conservation. The equations were determined mathematically by bvp4c function in MATLAB. This parametric analysis was imposed, and the important enhancement was by thermal behavior of Williamson fluid when the hybrid nanoparticles (magnetic oxide and graphene) were noted. This wall heat flux by hybrid nano-Williamson fluid (magnetic oxide, the combination of graphene and Williamson fluid) was essentially established higher than that of thermal behavior on the mixture by graphene and the Williamson fluid. This wall shear stress increases when the fluid parameter and magnetic field are raised. This rate of heat transmission raises this thermal radiation, and Biot numbers were raised. These hybrid nanofluids had several practical functions in the new industry like that in nanodrug delivery system, micro-manufacturing, nuclear reactors and periodic heat exchanges process.
