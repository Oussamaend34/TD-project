Mutations affecting sucrose metabolism have been mapped by PBS1 transduction on the Bacillus subtilis chromosome in seven loci sacA, sacB, sacQ, sacR, sacS, sacT and sacU. sacA and sacB are presumed to be the structural genes of a sucrase and a levansucrase respectively. sacR, sacS and sacT correspond to groups of mutations leading to constitutive synthesis of sucrase or both sucrase and levansucrase. In sacQ, sacS and sacU are located either mutations increasing the level of synthesis of levansucrase specifically (sacQ h , sacS h , sacU h ) or mutations abolishing specifically the synthesis of levansucrase (sacU − ). sacA, sacS and sacT map to the left of purA16. sacQ is located to the left of thr5, sacB and sacR between cysB3 and hisA1 and sacU between uvr1 and gtaB.
