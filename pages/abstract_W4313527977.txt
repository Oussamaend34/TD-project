Abstract Because of their excellent biologically active qualities, bioactive glasses (BGs) have been extensively used in the biomedical domain, leading to better tissue–implant interactions and promoting bone regeneration and wound healing. Aside from having attractive characteristics, BGs are appealing as a porous scaffold material. On the other hand, such porous scaffolds should enable tissue proliferation and integration with the natural bone and neighboring soft tissues and degrade at a rate that allows for new bone development while preventing bacterial colonization. Therefore, researchers have recently become interested in a different BG composition based on borate (B2O3) rather than silicate (SiO2). Furthermore, apatite synthesis in the borate-based bioactive glass (BBG) is faster than in the silicate-based bioactive glass, which slowly transforms to hydroxyapatite. This low chemical durability of BBG indicates a fast degradation process, which has become a concern for their utilization in biological and biomedical applications. To address these shortcomings, glass network modifiers, active ions, and other materials can be combined with BBG to improve the bioactivity, mechanical, and regenerative properties, including its degradation potential. To this end, this review article will highlight the details of BBGs, including their structure, properties, and medical applications, such as bone regeneration, wound care, and dental/bone implant coatings. Furthermore, the mechanism of BBG surface reaction kinetics and the role of doping ions in controlling the low chemical durability of BBG and its effects on osteogenesis and angiogenesis will be outlined.
