The main objective of this work is the study of the effects of high tides and low tides on fishing effort, catches as well as profits in a bioeconomic model of populations of Sardina pilchardus, Engraulis encrasicolus and Xiphias gladius in Moroccan areas. To achieve this objective, we studied the stability of the equilibrium points of our biological model then we added in our model the effect of the tides in the fishing effort which maximizes the profits of the fishermen under the constraint of the conservation of the biodiversity of these marine species using the generalized Nash equilibrium in the resolution of the bioeconomic model. As results, we were able to give the best fishing times according to the tides of each month of the whole year which will allow us to achieve better yields. Hence the importance of introducing the effect of high and low tides in bioeconomic models.
