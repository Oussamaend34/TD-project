Analysis of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal diversity through morphological characters of spores and intraradicular hyphae has suggested previously that preferential associations occur between plants and AM fungi. A field experiment was established to investigate whether AM fungal diversity is affected by different host plants in upland grasslands. Indigenous vegetation from plots in an unimproved pasture was replaced with monocultures of either Agrostis capillaris or Lolium perenne. Modification of the diversity of AM fungi in these plots was evaluated by analysis of partial sequences in the large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA (rDNA) genes. General primers for AM fungi were designed for the PCR amplification of partial sequences using DNA extracted from root tissues of A. capillaris and L. perenne. PCR products were used to construct LSU rDNA libraries. Sequencing of randomly selected clones indicated that plant roots were colonised by AM fungi belonging to the genera Glomus, Acaulospora and Scutellospora. There was a difference in the diversity of AM fungi colonising roots of A. capillaris and L. perenne that was confirmed by PCR using primers specific for each sequence group. These molecular data suggest the existence of a selection pressure of plants on AM fungal communities.
