Abstract This review paper provides a comprehensive overview of the recent trends in bismuth tungstate (Bi2WO6) research, covering its structural, electrical, photoluminescent, and photocatalytic properties. The structural characteristics of bismuth tungstate are explored in detail, including its different allotropic crystal structures with respect to its isotypic materials. The electrical properties of bismuth tungstate, such as its conductivity and electron mobility, are also discussed, along with its photoluminescent properties. The photocatalytic activity of bismuth tungstate is a particular focus, with recent advances in doping and co-doping strategies with metals, rare earth and other elements summarized. The limitations and challenges of using bismuth tungstate as a photocatalyst are also examined, such as its low quantum efficiency and susceptibility to photodegradation. Finally, recommendations for future research directions are provided, including the need for further studies on the underlying mechanisms of photocatalytic activity, the development of more efficient and stable bismuth tungstate-based photocatalysts, and the exploration of new applications in fields such as water treatment and energy conversion.
