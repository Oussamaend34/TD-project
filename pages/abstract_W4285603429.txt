Novel shellfish waste-derived chitosan (CS) has been developed to adsorb As(V) from simulated wastewater under evaluating adsorption process parameters. The coexistence of some competing ions, like SiO32-, Cl-, NO3– and PO43- as well as the regeneration capacity of the spent adsorbent, was explored. The experimental data were modeled using several kinetics and isotherm models to understand the mechanism related to the uptake process. As(V) uptake was relatively rapid and highly dependent on pH. The Avrami-fractional-order expression supported data best, while the Liu equation described well isotherm data at pH 5.0. The maximum uptake capability (Liu) was 12.32 mg/g, and the highest removal performance (99 %) was obtained at optimum pH 5.0. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to more clearly illuminate the atomic-level interactions between arsenic species and CS surface in both acidic and basic mediums. After four adsorption–desorption cycles, CS exhibited more than 90 % As(V) removal efficiency. The results of this study indicates that low cost shellfish derived chitosan is promising for efficient removal of As(V) from water body and can be used to remove other pollutants from watewater.
