This paper aims in a simulation work of a novel hybrid heterostructure based on carbon nanotubes as absorber layer with its unique electronic properties in semiconductor technology, and copper barium tin sulfide (CBTS) compound as a back surface field. Cell optimization was investigated in SCAPS–1D software for the architectures ITO/CdS/SWCNTs and ITO/CdS/SWCNTs/CBTS. The device performance and the influence of different materials parameters such as thickness, carrier concentration, and defect density are analyzed in this article. After adding the BSF layer and optimized physical parameters, promising results were achieved with PCE of 30.92%, Voc of 0.83 V, Jsc of 43.47 mA/cm2, and FF of 86.18%.
