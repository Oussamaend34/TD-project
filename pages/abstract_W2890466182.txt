Abstract This study involves the novel fabrication of a high responsivity, fast response, and low-cost (UV) photodetector (PD) based on ZnO/Ni nanoparticles deposited on a glass substrate. The ZnO/Ni nanoparticles were synthesized using a polyol process. The structure and the morphology of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Optical properties were measured using UV-visible, diffuse reflectance and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The photodetector exhibited high photoresponse characteristics under 375 nm laser excitation. Our device shows a high responsivity (121 A W−1) with rise time (about 5.52 s) and fall time (about 12 s) at a bias voltage of 1 V. The device exhibits excellent reproducibility and stability characteristics with time. The noise spectra obtained from the UV photodetector were caused by the 1/f noise. The noise-equivalent power (NEP) is 1.08 × 10−9 W. Thus, the polyol process can be a useful and effective method for improving the performance of ZnO/Ni UV photodetectors.
