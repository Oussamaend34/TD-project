Purpose of Review The aim of this paper is to provide an overview about reactive arthritis, with an update regarding pathophysiology and therapeutic approach of the disease, outlining the clinical features and diagnostic approach, based on recent literature review. Recent Findings Reactive arthritis is considered to be part of the spectrum of the spondyloarthritis. Its epidemiology is changing worldwide due to several reasons, among them are as follows: different diagnosis approach and clinical presentations, different grades of infection, microbiome changes, etc. The understanding of pathophysiological models is challenging, but recent studies contribute to elucidate the major factors involved in the development of the disease. The management of ReA depends on the triggering agent and the phase of disease, whether it is acute or chronic. Summary The association between the microbiome changes and spondyloarthropathies (ReA) is becoming increasingly evident. The results regarding the biologic treatment on refectory ReA are promising.
