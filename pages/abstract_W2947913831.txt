The objective of this study is the determination of the chemical structure of nine phenolic molecules responsible for the phytotoxic action on the germination of the plant species “Trigonella foenum-graecum”. The phytotoxic action was evaluated by calculating the germination index of the plant species for a period of 5 days of incubation. The analysis of the physicochemical properties of phenolic molecules shows that hydrophobicity is a key factor in phytotoxicity. The sublethal concentration varies as follows: hydroquinone (0.91 mM), 4-aminophenol (0.85 mM), phenol (0.75 mM), gallic acid (0.59 mM), caffeic acid (0.56 mM), 3,5-di-tert-butylcatechol (0,45 mM), quercetin (0.33 mM), oleuropein (0.3 mM), and catechol (0.13 mM). Phytotoxicity varies depending on the nature and position of the substituents on the aromatic ring. The reactivity of this type of molecule is partly linked to the presence of catechol function that can play the main role in phytotoxicity of the Fenugreek.
