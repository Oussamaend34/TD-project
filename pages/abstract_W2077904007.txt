Inheritance of nuclear microsatellite markers (nSSR) has been proved to be a powerful tool to verify or uncover the parentage of grapevine cultivars. The aim of the present study was to undertake an extended parentage analysis using a large sample of Vitis vinifera cultivars held in the INRA “Domaine de Vassal” Grape Germplasm Repository (France). A dataset of 2,344 unique genotypes (i.e. cultivars without synonyms, clones or mutants) identified using 20 nSSR was analysed with FAMOZ software. Parentages showing a logarithm of odds score higher than 18 were validated in relation to the historical data available. The analysis first revealed the full parentage of 828 cultivars resulting in: (1) 315 original full parentages uncovered for traditional cultivars, (2) 100 full parentages confirming results established with molecular markers in prior papers and 32 full parentages that invalidated prior results, (3) 255 full parentages confirming pedigrees as disclosed by the breeders and (4) 126 full parentages that invalidated breeders’ data. Second, incomplete parentages were determined in 1,087 cultivars due to the absence of complementary parents in our cultivar sample. Last, a group of 276 genotypes showed no direct relationship with any other cultivar in the collection. Compiling these results from the largest set of parentage data published so far both enlarges and clarifies our knowledge of the genetic constitution of cultivated V. vinifera germplasm. It also allows the identification of the main genitors involved in varietal assortment evolution and grapevine breeding.
