Abstract The healthcare sector plays a pivotal role in both generating and relying on vast amounts of data, emphasizing the significance of collecting, managing, and sharing information. Technological advancements have facilitated the transformation of healthcare data into electronic health records (EHRs). These digital records are disseminated among various stakeholders, including patients, healthcare professionals, providers, insurance companies, and pharmacies. Given the sensitivity of healthcare information, the assimilation of new technologies is paramount. Blockchain technology, with its immutable nature and decentralized features, has emerged as a promising solution to instigate changes in the healthcare system. In the healthcare domain, where confidentiality is crucial, strict regulations are in place to safeguard patient privacy. Frameworks like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) are designed to mitigate the risks associated with health data breaches. Although blockchain's characteristics, such as enhanced interoperability, anonymity, and access control, can improve the overall landscape of health data management, it is imperative for blockchain applications to adhere to existing regulatory frameworks for practical implementation. This paper delves into the examination of the compliance of blockchain-based EHR systems with regulations like HIPAA and GDPR. Additionally, it introduces a Blockchain-based EHR model specifically crafted to seamlessly align with regulatory requirements, ensuring its viability and effectiveness in real-world scenarios
