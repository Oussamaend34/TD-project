Abstract To determine the epidemiology and trends of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) in France, we analyzed incidence, risk factors, and in-hospital death rates related to the most frequent IFIs registered in the national hospital discharge database during 2001–2010. The identified 35,876 IFI cases included candidemia (43.4%), Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (26.1%), invasive aspergillosis (IA, 23.9%), cryptococcosis (5.2%), and mucormycosis (1.5%). The overall incidence was 5.9/100,000 cases/year and the mortality rate was 27.6%; both increased over the period (+1.5%, +2.9%/year, respectively). Incidences substantially increased for candidemia, IA, and mucormycosis. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia incidence decreased among AIDS patients (−14.3%/year) but increased in non-HIV–infected patients (+13.3%/year). Candidemia and IA incidence was increased among patients with hematologic malignancies (>+4%/year) and those with chronic renal failure (>+10%/year). In-hospital deaths substantially increased in some groups, e.g., in those with hematologic malignancies. IFIs occur among a broad spectrum of non–HIV-infected patients and should be a major public health priority. Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are reportedly increasing in many countries, especially candidemia and invasive aspergillosis (IA) among immunocompromised patients (1–4). Conversely, a decline of AIDS-associated Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (Pjp) and cryptococcosis has been observed in Western countries since the advent of highly active antiretroviral treatments (5,6). Many publications provide insight on a given IFI and its trends in specific risk groups, but the overall burden of illness associated with IFI and its trends at a country level have not been described (7–10). To describe the epidemiology and trends of IFIs and to better identify public health priorities (e.g., surveillance, research, prevention strategies), we analyzed the national hospital discharge database of France, Programme de Médicalisation du Système d’Information, spanning 2001–2010.
