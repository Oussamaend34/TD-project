This paper proposes optimal control strategies of a standalone Hybrid Power System (HPS) to supply sustainable and optimal energy to an isolated site with improved quality of electrical energy. A topology of Isolated Hybrid Power System (IHPS) is proposed, consists of: a Photovoltaic System (PVS), a Wind Energy Conversion System (WECS), electronic power devices controlled to maximize energy production from renewable sources and to maintain the constant DC-link voltage, a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), Diesel Generator (DG), and a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) located at the load-side end. In addition, a novel control strategy has been proposed, in this work, to maximize the power from the PVS. This presented strategy, based on the combination between Perturb and Observe (P&O) algorithm and the Fuzzy PI Controller (FPIC), presents a good performance, especially in the dynamic state compared to the classical algorithm P&O. A supervisory control algorithm has been elaborated to manage the energy flows between the devices of the hybrid system to make the decision of the optimal operating mode in order to ensure a continuous supply of the load with minimum usage of batteries and DG. The simulation results developed in the Matlab/Simulink environment are applied to show the efficiency and performance of the proposed control strategies in terms of power optimization and energy management.
