Five crosses were made, using a set of New Zealand wheat cultivars, to measure the effect of glutenin allele differences on baking quality parameters. The alleles involved were: Glu-A1 (2*, 1 and n), Glu-D1 (5+10, 2+12), Glu-A3 (c, d and e), Glu-B3 (Sec-12, Sec-13, b and g), Glu-D3 (a and b). The allelic variation of F3 individual plants was identified by SDS-PAGE, and plants with the same HMW-GS and LMW-GS patterns were grouped. Quality parameters were then measured on the grouped F4 bulks. Quality parameters measured for this study were wholemeal flour protein content (WFP), grain hardness (HAR), SDS sedimentation volume (SED), Pelshenke time (PEL), mid-line peak value (MPV) and the mid-line peak time (MPT) of a mixograph. The results showed there were significant quality differences within most populations associated with the possession of a particular allele, reaching magnitudes of up to 42% for the range between populations. Most glutenin allelic comparisons showed significant differences for at least one of the resultant measured quality parameters. Allelic differences of Glu-A1 significantly influenced all characters except MPT, with the null allele apparently inferior; possession of 5+10 at Glu-D1 significantly increased Pelshenke time and SED volumes relative to allele 2+12; WFP, SED and MPV were significantly affected by the Glu-A3 alleles tested. Glu-B3 alleles significantly affected all characters except hardness and the Glu-D3 alleles tested significantly affected all characters other than hardness and SDS sedimentation volume.
