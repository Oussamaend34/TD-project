Phosphogypsum (PG) waste is a by-product generated from wet-process phosphoric acid (H3PO4) manufacturing during phosphate rock decomposition. Worldwide, the annual production of PG ranges between 100 and 300 million tons, with only a few quantities utilized in several application domains (about 15%), the unused PG is usually discharged into the sea or stocked in large stockpiles with potential serious human and environmental risks. Therefore, in this review article, we have studied and discussed the possible alternative ways for PG waste recycling and use. Indeed, this waste material could be considered as a mineral resource of secondary raw materials within the scope of a circular economy. An inclusive bibliographic search, dealing with our review’s objectives, was performed according to the two famous-databases: Web of Sciences and Scopus. After different selecting processes, about 153 articles are found. PG is used in several sectors, including agriculture, as well as in the brick and cement industry, and road construction. Other applications are reported in this study such as PG conversion to valuable products and rare earths elements (REEs) extraction. In the same context and in the sense of reducing greenhouse gasses emissions (GHGs), PG is often used as a calcium source for CO2 mineral sequestration. In addition, different methods of treatment and purification, techno-economic, life cycle and environmental assessment of the PG recycling, and valorization technologies are summarized and reported in this review. Finally, recent technologies used for extracting REEs from PG were investigated. The main results, conclusions, and recommendations reported here could considered as a guide for future studies, and also should be of benefit to scientists, chemists and engineers interested in the utilization/ treatment of PG.
