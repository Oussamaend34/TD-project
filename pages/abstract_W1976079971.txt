Recent years have witnessed the boom of cavity optomechanics, which exploits the confinement and coupling of optical and mechanical waves at the nanoscale. Among their physical implementations, optomechanical (OM) crystals built on semiconductor slabs enable the integration and manipulation of multiple OM elements in a single chip and provide gigahertz phonons suitable for coherent phonon manipulation. Different demonstrations of coupling of infrared photons and gigahertz phonons in cavities created by inserting defects on OM crystals have been performed. However, the considered structures do not show a complete phononic bandgap, which should enable longer lifetimes, as acoustic leakage is minimized. Here we demonstrate the excitation of acoustic modes in a one-dimensional OM crystal properly designed to display a full phononic bandgap for acoustic modes at 4 GHz. The modes inside the complete bandgap are designed to have high-mechanical Q-factors, limit clamping losses and be invariant to fabrication imperfections. Cavity optomechanics connects light to the mechanical degrees of freedom of a resonator and has great potential for sensing applications. Here, the authors realize a one-dimensional optomechanical crystal with a complete phononic bandgap containing high Q-factor modes and limited clamping losses.
