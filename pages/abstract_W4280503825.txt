One of agriculture’s most important goals is finding the proper equilibrium between sustainability and intensification of production. The exponential growth of the world population, climate variability, and soil degradation are essential factors that require the development of novel agricultural practices to achieve food security. In this context, organo-mineral fertilization has been proposed as a promising approach. Such a concept is based on novel fertilizers formulations combining organic and mineral resources features, which could simultaneously address soil fertility and health issues. The manufacturing processes of organo-mineral fertilizers (OMF) are highly versatile and revolve around the co-processing of organic and mineral matrices. OMF’s peculiarity resides in using systemic methodologies for waste valorization to generate cost-effective and eco-friendly products in alignment with the bio-circular economy. Despite their advantages, OMF adoption by farmers is still not satisfactory, which could be attributed to the difficulty of accessibility and a stagnant market. This work critically reviews recent advances in the organo-mineral fertilization concept. Our review provides an in-depth understanding of the chemical, biological, and thermal methodologies used for OMF generation through mineral and organic matrices co-processing. We also discuss the positive effect of such products on the plant-soil system by focusing on the mechanism of action. Furthermore, this review scrutinizes the innovation profile of OMF based on trends of patent submission during the last 20 years. It also provides future research and development pathways based on current drawbacks and limitations of the industry. Graphical abstract
