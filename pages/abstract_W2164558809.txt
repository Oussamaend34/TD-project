The definition of "bioactive compound" knowdynamism, because the scientific research on the bioactivity potential is booming nowadays. And since there is no unifying definition, attempts to find a consensus and some common elements of the concept associated with the term "bioactive" did not stop, even if vague definitions and repeated use of the operative word "bioactive" almost integrated the term in a category of magic words! This paper tried to find a combined definition which can be a platform to develop the "bioactive" concept, and reach a solid consensus on the term "bioactive compound".
