The Monte Carlo simulations were used to investigate the ground-state phase diagrams of Ising nanowires for core–shell structure with mixed spins 3/2 and 2. The magnetic phase diagrams obtained found and are dependent of crystal and magnetic fields. Magnetic phase diagrams are dependent of exchange interactions for n-polygon at the surface shell and are dependent also of crystal field. The exchange interaction dependences of magnetization and the transition temperature are calculated by Monte Carlo simulation. The changes of magnetization depending on the crystal field and n-polygon increasing. The phase transition from ordered phase to disordered phase is found. The transitions temperatures are found of each polygon. The magnetic coercive fields, saturations and remanent magnetizations have been deduced for different magnetic parameters. The surface of hysteresis cycle is dependent of the effect of n-polygon, temperature, and exchange interactions. This magnetic behavior offers new perspectives for applications in advanced technologies including spintronics, logic devices and novel magnetic recording media, functionalization and bioengineering and sensor devises.
