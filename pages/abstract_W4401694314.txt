Biomass and organic residues are increasingly recognized as valuable resources for bioenergy production. Lignocellulosic biomass offers sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels for generation of bioenergy (such as biogas, bioethanol, biodiesel, and biohydrogen). Pretreatment plays a crucial role in a biomass biorefinery. It increases biomass homogeneity and production yields, thereby overcoming transportation and storage problems. However, the absence of a clear plan for biomass pretreatment represents a challenge for biomass conversion procedures. The socio-economic effects of biomass utilization are not unequivocally constructive. High investment and capital costs, technological maturity of biofuels, large-scale biomass supply, and policy and regulatory issues are among the key challenges. Despite these challenges, with the right strategies and solutions, complete biomass valorization is achievable. Solutions such as quick capital cost estimation, upgrading existing plants, optimizing biomass feedstock blends, utilizing waste biomass resources, and improving machinery efficiencies can address these challenges. Policy and regulatory challenges can be tackled through clear and long-term targets, financial and fiscal incentives, mandates and obligations, and sustainability governance supported by regulations and certifications. However, the realization of these benefits would depend on various factors such as the specific context of the biomass utilization, the available resources, and the market conditions. Thus, this work critically reviews the status of bioenergy production, the socio-economic challenges of biomass pretreatment, and its diversity in the bioenergy set-up.
