High rate outdoor production units of microalgae can undergo temperature fluctuations. Seasonal temperature variations as well as more rapid daily fluctuations are liable to modify the growth conditions of microalgae and hence affect production efficiency. The effect of elevated temperatures, above optimal growth temperatures, on growth is seldom reported in literature, but often described as more deleterious than low temperatures. Depending on the species, different strategies are deployed to counteract the effect of above optimal temperatures such as energy re-balancing and cell shrinking. Moreover, long term adaptation of certain species over generation cycles has also been proven efficient to increase optimal temperatures. Physical models coupled to biological kinetics are able to predict the evolution of temperature in the growth media and its effect on the growth rate, highlighting the downstream drastic economic and environmental impacts. Regarding the relative elasticity of microalgae towards temperature issues, cell mortality can depend on species or adapted species and in certain cases can be attenuated. These elements can complement existing models and help visualize the effective impacts of temperature on outdoor cultures.
