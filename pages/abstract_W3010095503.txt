Abstract Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials, such as graphene and single layer covalent organic frameworks (sCOFs) are being widely studied due to their unusual structure/property relationships. sCOFs typically feature atomic thickness, intrinsic nanoscale porosity and a crystalline lattice. Compared to other organic 2D materials, sCOFs exhibit major advantages including topological designation and constitutional tunability. This review describes the state of the art of surface-confined sCOFs, emphasizing reticular design, synthesis approaches, and key challenges related to improving quality and exploring applications.
