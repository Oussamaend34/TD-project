AbstractIn Africa, the first Plasmodium falciparum Kelch13 (K13) artemisinin partial resistance mutation 561H was first detected and validated in Rwanda. Surveillance to better define the extent of the emergence in Rwanda and neighboring countries as other mutations arise in East Africa is critical. We employ a novel scheme of liquid blood drop preservation combined with pooled sequencing to provide a cost-effective rapid assessment of resistance mutation frequencies at multiple collection sites across Rwanda and neighboring countries. Malaria-positive samples (n=5,465) were collected from 39 health facilities in Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) between May 2022 and March 2023 and sequenced in 199 pools. In Rwanda, K13 561H and 675V were detected in 90% and 65% of sites with an average frequency of 19.0% (0-54.5%) and 5.0% (0-35.5%), respectively. In Tanzania, 561H had high frequency in multiple sites while it was absent from the DRC although 675V was seen at low frequency. Conceringly candidate mutations were observed: 441L, 449A, and 469F co-occurred with validated mutations suggesting they are arising under the same pressures. Other resistance markers associated with artemether-lumefantrine are common: P. falciparum multidrug resistance protein 1 N86 at 98.0% and 184F at 47.0% (0-94.3%) and P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter 76T at 14.7% (0-58.6%). Additionally, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine-associated mutations show high frequencies.Overall, K13 mutations are rapidly expanding in the region further endangering control efforts with the potential of engendering partner drug resistance.
