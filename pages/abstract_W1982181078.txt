Resistance of Brassica napus (oilseed rape, canola) conferred by three different major resistance genes has been overcome by changes in virulence of Leptosphaeria maculans populations in France and Australia. In South Australia where B. napus cultivars with major gene resistance derived from Brassica rapa ssp. sylvestris were grown extensively, resistance was rendered ineffective within 3 years of commercial release of the cultivar. Disease severity was higher on cultivars with sylvestris-derived resistance than cultivars with polygenic resistance. This Australian situation is compared to that in France, where resistance conferred by the Rlm1 gene was overcome nation-wide in 5 years under commercial cropping practices, and also where a source of resistance introgressed into B. napus from B. juncea was rendered inefficient in 3 years in experimental field plots near Rennes.
