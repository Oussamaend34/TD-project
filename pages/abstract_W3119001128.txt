Antisolvent behavior is one of the most important treatments for producing high-quality perovskite MaPbI3 thin films. However, the optimization of the amount of antisolvent used has not been analyzed on a uniform platform. In this work, a systematic study is employed to quantitively evaluate the impact of anti-solvent treatment on the morphological, structural, and optoelectronic characteristics of MAPbI3 films. The results confirm that an adequate amount of 2.5 ml with a slow annealing treatment leads to homogeneous perovskite films with virtually no holes and large grain size. Using antisolvent treatment and optimized thermal annealing, we were able to control the nucleation and growth of the MAPbI3, and therefore achieve highly compact perovskite films with large grains, excellent crystalline quality, and very low pinhole density. The results of this study could help establish reproducible manufacturing processes for perovskite solar cells.
